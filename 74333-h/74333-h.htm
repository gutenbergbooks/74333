  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The present publication is the result of observations
made during an extended tour in the central portion of
Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most ample facilities for exploring the territory
were afforded by the authorities of the empire, and more
especially by that high-toned gentleman and liberal-minded
statesman, Conselheiro Dom Antonio Francisco
de Paula e Sousa, to whose personal and official support
is due whatever of value may attach to this collection
of facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>This daily record was made for the information of a
number of personal friends, but the conviction that many
other persons are also interested in a region of such vast
resources, induces the author to submit it to the public,
as a faithful description of the soil, productive climate,
people and government, of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the requisites of a desirable home have been
found in Brazil; and a consideration of the data here
presented may enable those concerned to determine upon
the propriety of transferring their residence to that
favored land.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>HUNTING A HOME IN BRAZIL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Having made a pleasant voyage from New York, it was
announced early on the morning of Tuesday, September
12th, 1865, that our vessel had passed Cape Frio, and
that we were approaching the harbor of Rio de Janeiro.
The rugged shore upon our right hand presented rather a
dreary aspect, relieved now and then by a few scrubby
trees, or the green foliage of vines springing from the crevices
of the rocks. This mountainous rock-bound coast is
very irregular in its outline; and the ocean, dashing against
its base, throws the white foam of the waves high upon its
sloping edge, then to break into spray, and fall back into
roaring waters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The guardians of the entrance consist of two conical
islands of solid rock, known as Pai (father) and Mai,
(mother.) Farther south there is another small island of
rock, upon which stands a light-house to guide vessels
approaching at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The indications for the mariner are so distinct, and the
water so deep and free from obstructions at all points, that
pilots are not required.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gigantic and towering spire of rock, known as the
Sugar Loaf mountain, first attracts attention in nearing
the city, but all must realize that it fails signally in its
resemblance to the conformation of a sugar loaf. In one
position, when nearly opposite to it, as our vessel passed
into the harbor, the proportions of a cone with a regularly
defined outline were somewhat striking, but in all other
situations it simply presented a huge peak of rock, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the left of the immediate entrance to the city. There is
also another conical peak upon the right side, and though
not in exact opposition to this, they serve as immense pillars,
constituting the portals of this maritime metropolis of
the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The atmosphere had become sensibly cooler during the
night, and it was observed in approaching the harbor that
the thermometer had descended to 70° Fahrenheit, for the
first time during the voyage. The temperature from 20°
north latitude, to 20° south latitude, varied from 80° to
85°, but it has gradually fallen since passing 20° south latitude,
until now, in 22° 56′ and west longitude 43° 09′, we
have the very comfortable temperature above mentioned.
Early this morning my overcoat was found very agreeable,
and this state of the atmosphere is in striking contrast to
all the representations ever received as to the climate of
this region. Indeed, the temperature has not been oppressive
at any time during the voyage, except for a few
days after leaving New York; and instead of the sultry
atmosphere which was anticipated in passing the equator,
a pleasant breeze was at all times prevailing. It is highly
probable that this influence of the sea-breeze may not be so
sensibly felt in the city and harbor of Rio, which is locked
in by mountains upon every side, except the narrow entrance
to the harbor between the lofty cliffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon approaching this gorge-like opening of the mountains
from the sea, we get a distant view of the shipping,
and that portion of the city immediately upon the margin
of the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large fort called Fortaleza da Conceicão is seen upon
the right, projecting out boldly into the water, while on the
left an extensive range of neat and commodious barracks
is seen at a considerable distance, between two elevated
projections formed of land and rock. Upon getting opposite
the fort, an officer upon the ramparts called out
to know from what port our vessel came. The captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>replied, “From New York.” The officer called again, “How
long out?” to which the captain answered, “Fifty-one days.”
The call was made through a trumpet, and our flag being
English,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> the language corresponded to the supposed nationality
of the vessel; but I confess that it would have required
good guessing to divine what was said, and the captain’s
answers were made according to his preconceived idea of
the questions that would be asked at this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now observed ahead two other forts, one to the right
having the appearance of being formed from the solid stone,
while the other on the left seemed to be constructed of hewn
stone. Each of these works had quite a number of guns of
small calibre placed in barbette, while the large fort was
arranged with casemates, as well as embrasures in the
ramparts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to these structures for the defence of the
harbor, there were several works visible upon the cliffs on
either side, which might serve to annoy, and even damage,
the vessels of a fleet, without being in any way liable to
injury from the hostile guns. The known efficacy of a
plunging shot could be brought into operation from these
elevated positions, while the gunners would not only have
exemption, by the difficulty of elevating guns to reach such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>a height, but are effectually protected against an enfilading
fire by the peaks of solid rock which flank these works on
each side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our bark came to anchor shortly after passing the forts,
when a custom-house officer and an officer of the police
came aboard, to get the manifest of the vessel and report
of her passengers. We gave up our passports and reported
our baggage, with the understanding that it had to be taken
to the custom-house for examination, previous to its going
ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>This official, who examined our passports, could not
converse in English, yet asked each man if he was single,
which I supposed was to elicit information whether there
was any one under his charge on the bark, and answered
in the affirmative. The captain, observing the mistake,
stated that he desired to know whether I was single or
married, when my entry was changed to correspond to the
responsibilities of a family. These officials were very polite
in their demeanor towards us, and shook hands with all
upon leaving.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain now had his boat lowered and took the other
passengers and myself with him to the city. It being late
in the afternoon, and nearly two miles to the wharf, our
four oarsmen had a stiff pull, to take us with that despatch
which was desired, to secure time for business on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>We passed through the shipping which lay in the outer
bay, and immediately past the guard-ship, so that it might
be seen that nothing was taken ashore in the boat. Upon
nearing the wharf, we encountered a large number of small
boats manned by negroes or Portuguese, and a few by the
sailors from the different vessels in the harbor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving the bark, it should be mentioned that
several boats came along side with cards from the respective
ship chandlers, which they were very intent upon delivering
to the captain, with an invitation to take a seat in the boat
for a row to the city. One of these was from the firm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Baldwin &#38; Co., with which he expected to deal, and at
which we stopped a short time after going ashore. Mr.
Baldwin had left the city for a visit to Baltimore, and we
were told that his impression was, that an honest man ought
not to continue in this branch of business. The house
however seems to be well supplied with the various articles
usually needed aboard of ships, and it is likely that persons
needing to purchase any thing in this line may do so on as
favorable terms here as elsewhere in the city of Rio.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this place, which is very near the wharf, we proceeded
with the captain to the house of Phipps Brothers
&#38; Co., on Rua Pescadores, who are the consignees of his
cargo. The young men in the office spoke English, and
were very accommodating in giving us information in regard
to various matters outside of their business. We learned
that Colonel Clarey from the city of Baltimore had arrived
in this city a few days previous, and it was supposed that
he was still here. But we were subsequently informed that
he had left the city, and proceeded by way of Santos to the
city of São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>In passing through this business part of the city, several
negro men were seen with little else than a cloth around
their loins, carrying immense burdens; while negro women
were seated upon the side-walks with the body of a chemise
as the only covering above their waists. These women
were engaged in traffic of various kinds, and seemed to be
as entirely unconscious of any undue exposure as we would
suppose Eve was, originally, in the garden of Eden.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain had some Brazilian money, and made a very
satisfactory trade with one of these women, getting three
oranges for a dump, which is equal to two cents, and bought
enough to give us all a good bait of this delicious fruit. I
had a United States twenty-five cent coin, for which she
was only willing to allow me eight dumps or sixteen cents,
but I declined her proposition, and afterwards got ten dumps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>or twenty cents for my quarter of a dollar,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and invested a
portion of it forthwith in oranges. It is one of my weak
points to have an inordinate fondness for oranges, and
this fruit being unusually fine in Rio, and very cheap, I
expect to consume a large number daily. Bananas are also
very abundant and very cheap; but it is not the season for
pine-apples, and the few here are held at high prices, even
as much as fifty cents each.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was struck with the large strings of onions that were
seen hanging in almost every part of the market, and was
told that they are shipped to the port from Portugal in
immense numbers, though the soil and climate of Brazil is
said to be well adapted to their production. Those things
which grow here in great abundance, without work, satisfy
the wants of the lower class of people, and they do not care
to devote their energies to tilling the soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The streets of Rio de Janeiro, in the business portion
of the city, through which we passed, are for the most part
very narrow, and having a depression in the middle to serve
as a drain. It is difficult for two carts or other vehicles to
pass each other, and on one occasion we had to enter the
door of a store to avoid contact with the wheels, when two
carts were passing in one of these narrow defiles leading
to the store of Phipps Brothers &#38; Co. In going to this
place, however, we passed through Rua da Direita, which is
at this portion perhaps the broadest street in the city, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>upon this is located the business palace and the church of
the Emperor, Dom Pedro II.</p>

<p class='c007'>In front of these buildings is an open plaza, with a
fountain of water on the opposite side, at which persons
may be seen almost constantly filling their vessels with the
pure and limpid fluid, that is conveyed by an aqueduct from
the hills outside of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>This plaza is constantly occupied with carriages and
hacks for hire, and there are also quite a number of two-wheeled
tilburys, having accommodation for but one person
beside the driver. Mules are generally driven in these
vehicles, two to the former, and one to the latter, and while
they are used almost exclusively in all public equipages,
it is not uncommon to see a fine pair of mules likewise in
an elegant private carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mules here present a fine appearance, being of large
size and having good action, with apparently more life and
spirit than the mules with us in the United States. This
however is accounted for by the comparatively light service
which is done by them, which came under my observation
during this afternoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observed that horses are also used in private equipages
and for the saddle, but they did not strike me as being of
superior quality. There was a number of fancy-colored
horses of rather small size, in single harness, and they seemed
to be compact, hardy animals, with good action, and fine
spirit. They belong doubtless to the stock of wild horses
captured in the plains of Buenos Ayres or in the lower provinces
of Brazil, yet I had no opportunity of instituting an
inquiry as to their origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many vehicles seen in the streets of Rio de
Janeiro I observed nothing like the buggy which is in
common use in the United States; and the two-wheeled,
one horse tilbury is so much better adapted to narrow
streets and short turns that it is not likely that it will find
a rival soon in the four-wheeled buggy of modern invention.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Omnibuses or “diligencia” are seen moving to and fro
with great activity, and this progressive feature of a business
people is evidently in successful operation, with the
usual advantages accruing to a large number of customers,
over that of carriages and tilburys, which are only hired
by the few for transportation to a special point. The large
number of negroes that are seen upon the streets, both male
and female, with the marks of tattooing upon their cheeks,
and in the persons of the females with fancy figures on their
arms, indicates that the African slave-trade has been carried
on with this country very actively at a comparatively recent
period. Most of them appear strong and active, while
many are not exceeding twenty-five years of age. The men
were employed in such business as we might expect slaves
to do, but most of the women were selling fruit or trafficking
in other little dainties, as if they might be free.</p>

<p class='c007'>I learn that it is a common thing here for a number of
slaves to hire their time, and form a combination together
to work out their freedom. It is decided by lot who is first
made free, and the order in which the others are found, and
yet all are bound to remain together and contribute all
that is received into the common treasury, until the last is
liberated.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> This is among the men, and I don’t know that
any such arrangement has been adopted by the women.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon returning to our boat, we had a view of the line of
ferry boats, which has been introduced here, upon the same
plan as that adopted at New York and elsewhere in the
United States. A gentleman from North Carolina named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Rainey organized a company here some years ago, and has
brought out two double-enders from New York for this
service, which run from the city proper across to Nitherohi
and other points. Their trips are made with great regularity
every half hour, accommodating a large number of
people.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After returning from the city last night, my overcoat was
found comfortable, and a blanket was used for covering
during the night. The temperature this morning is very
pleasant upon the water, it being 72° by Fahrenheit’s thermometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having learned from Phipps &#38; Co. that a vessel was
expected to leave to-morrow for Baltimore, I made an addition
to a letter written on yesterday to my wife, and putting
a United States postage stamp upon it, I gave it to these
gentlemen to be forwarded by the captain of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon inquiry for letters at the post-office this morning,
I was handed a long list of written names with the simple
announcement “English” by the clerk. This implied that
these persons had letters in the office, which had come
through English mail, but most of the names were either
Portuguese or Spanish, and very few really English. My
own not being on the list, it was inferred that no letter had
arrived for me. As I had left home upon the 26th of June,
and gone by way of New Orleans to New York, occupying
an entire month before leaving the latter port, there had
evidently been sufficient time for any communication that
might have been sent direct, to reach this city in advance
of my arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must encounter many difficulties in my intercourse with
the people of this country, from the ignorance of their language,
and my objects in the line of business will be to
some extent embarrassed; but there being a good many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>people here who speak both English and Portuguese, it may
be in my power to obtain an interpreter when needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having letters from Colonel A. V. Brumly to Mr. M.
Tweedle and Mr. Robert Habersham, who I expected to find
employed in the engineer department of the Dom Pedro
II. Railroad Co., I repaired to their building, and was
pleased to find that Major Ellison, chief engineer,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and his
brother, also employed in this office, were both from the
United States. I learned that Mr. Tweedle had left the
road and the country long since, and that Mr. Habersham
was in charge of the construction section sixteen miles
above the terminus of the present track. As I wish to see
the country along the line of this road and on its projected
route, I hope at a future day to make a visit to Mr. Habersham.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was referred to Mr. G. N. Davis, No. 92 Rua da Direita,
for directions to the office of Senor Don Galvão, the official
agent of colonization, and when he was informed as to my
wishes, I was pleased to hear his proposition to accompany
me whenever it might suit me to make the visit. Mr. Davis
also said that he could provide a room over his store for
Mr. Mallory and myself, and we will eat at the restaurants,
until something further can be learned as to our movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>I met to-day at the store of Baldwin &#38; Co. Dr. Henry
C. Bosworth, who gave me information in regard to various
matters of interest, and tendered his services at any time
that he could be of any assistance to me. He is from the
United States, and practised dentistry in this city for a
number of years very successfully, but has now retired from
that business, and has an interest in the ferry company,
which promises to be a very profitable investment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the impression of Mr. Mallory that Dr. Bosworth
will render him very important aid in getting into business,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and from his courteous manner, and his general intelligence,
I would expect him to have considerable influence among
the people and the officials of this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were likewise introduced to a Mr. Smith, who came
from Virginia some five years since, and has been engaged
here in railroad contracts, which he says have proved advantageous
to him. He accompanied us to one of the public
gardens of the city, where we saw a variety of rare birds,
among which were a pair of large white swans and a large
black swan, with some water-fowls of a beautiful red hue
and very graceful form. In the fish-pond we were told there
was an immense specimen of what is known as the ox fish,
that feeds upon cabbage and various other vegetables; but
it did not come to the surface, and the water being muddy
at the time, we failed to get a sight of this curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Smith now has a contract with the city improvement
company, who are employed by the government to arrange
sewers, for all parts of the city, by underground drains,
which shall take every thing to receivers at the margin of
the water, and there undergo a process of disinfection and
purification.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> In connection with this, it is contemplated,
likewise, to construct a privy upon each man’s premises,
whether he may desire it or not, and thus make amends for
the total neglect of this household arrangement in by-gone
years and even at the present time.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>As a substitute for privies, chamber-pots or wooden stands
of various forms and capacities are used in all the private
and public houses of the city. These are emptied daily or
at stated periods, and the contents carried by negroes in
wooden cans, upon their heads, after dark, and emptied into
the harbor. By the use of coal tar in the vessels kept in
the houses any unpleasant odor is to a great extent prevented;
yet the whole programme is disgusting, and the
people may well congratulate themselves upon the new
order of things which is inaugurated by this city improvement
company. At present it is a common practice for
men of all classes of society to urinate upon the side-walks,
in the most fashionable and most frequented streets of the
city, and the stench in passing some of the recesses that
are most frequently resorted to is such, that it is a matter
of surprise to learn that there is no public ordinance forbidding
this offensive nuisance.</p>

<p class='c007'>We returned in the evening with the captain, and found
the atmosphere more pleasant upon the water than in the
crowded thoroughfares of the city. I was particularly
struck with the beautiful display of the gas-lights of the
city, as seen from the deck of our bark. The precise and
distinct lines of light along the margins of the water formed
a pleasing contrast with the irregularities of the winding
ways upon the hillsides, and the dazzling points to be seen
here and there in the private grounds. To appreciate fully
the rare beauty of this view, it is proper to state that the
city of Rio de Janeiro was originally located in a cove, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>is surrounded by elevated hills, and these again having a
bordering range of mountain cliffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the present day all these lesser hills are occupied by
residents, and here many of the finest houses and most
tasteful grounds of the city are arranged, one above another,
to the very summit of these elevations. It is upon these
slopes that the gas-lights present such an interesting display,
when viewed in the quietness of night from the shipping in
the harbor. The lamps upon the vessels, moving gently to
and fro under the swelling of the waves, are seen in every
direction around, like so many fire-flies filling the air; but
the glittering lights of the city present more the aspect of
brilliant constellations, and were viewed with that kind of
satisfaction which is felt in looking upon the firmament in
a clear night. While I sat upon a coil of rope contemplating
this scene, the deep-toned bells of the city sent forth a
sound, that was faintly echoed by the numerous bells of the
many vessels striking the passing hour; and apart from
this, all was serene and quiet in the bay and city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The busy stir of vehicles upon land, and the moving hither
and thither of boats of all grades upon the water, which is
so characteristic of this centre of commerce and trade during
the day, all ceases at night; and rest or recreation is the
recourse of the laborer and man of business, while for the
student comes meditation.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We expected to move into the city to-day; and being
advised that my cans of tomatoes, peaches, and pickles,
with some tobacco, which had been brought from New
York, might not pass through the custom-house unless
they were included in my baggage, I put all into my mess-chest.
These articles had been procured with the expectation
that they would be required on the voyage, and finding
the vessel well supplied, very little had been used; yet I
wished to retain them for use in exploring the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>where provisions might be scarce, and hence declined to
accept the offer of the captain to buy them for the bark.
Upon entering the custom-house with these things, and
foreseeing the importance of having these matters understood
by the officers in advance of their examination, I requested
Mr. Hagins, who does business with Mr. Davis, to
proceed with me to the custom-house and represent the
facts. He gave them to understand that the articles were
not for sale, but for my own consumption, and, after some
difficulty, arranged the matter without any charge for duty
or the imposition of any fine for violation of regulations.</p>

<p class='c007'>We moved into the room in the third story above the
store of Mr. G. N. Davis, which is rather contracted in proportions,
but has the recommendation of being well ventilated,
and having a water view from the windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apparent ease with which my heavy mess-chest was
carried up three flights of stairs surprised me. It was a
good lift for two of us to get it from the bark to the small
boat, and yet this African negro carried it upon his head
from the custom-house and up the stairs without any inconvenience;
for which service I was told that two dumps,
or four cents, was considered a proper compensation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a peculiarity of this city, that burdens are generally
carried by the negroes upon their heads.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> A large and
heavy piece of furniture will very often be carried upon the
heads of four or six negro men, who keep the step together
by chanting or by tapping a bell. They usually have upon
their heads a piece of cloth rolled up after the turban style,
which prevents the direct contact of the hard substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>that is carried. The ordinary receptacle for a number of
articles to be carried is a large, flat wicker-basket, with a
concavo-convex bottom, which fits upon the head; and they
move along with quite a load in these baskets, giving no
assistance whatever with the hands. In some instances
they are seen plaiting straw, or sewing up the material in
the form of a hat, while carrying these loads; which indicates
a spirit of industry that was scarcely to be expected
of the negro race. I am informed that the greater portion
of the negroes doing this kind of business are slaves, who
hire their own time, and all is for their personal benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>We dined at a restaurant, and our bill of fare consisted
of pork cutlet, beefsteak, potted beef, fried Irish potatoes,
salad, cucumbers, and coffee, with bread of excellent quality.
For dessert, we had marmalade, oranges, and bananas,
making, together, a most substantial dinner. The cost for
both of us was one dollar and seventy-five cents, which,
being eighty-seven and a half cents each, was rather more
expensive living than our pecuniary resources would warrant.
I had not spent any thing, however, in getting
ashore, and having done more physical labor than usual,
my appetite called for something extra, and it was enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dining, we found that night was approaching, and
the gas-lights were already emitting their brilliancy upon
the streets. We walked down to the open space provided
with seats in front of the Circle de Commerce, upon Rua
da Direita, and seated ourselves, for the purpose of observing
the manners and customs of the people. I was impressed
with the genteel bearing of those who resorted to this
rendezvous; and quite a large number of well-dressed gentlemen
were seated here, or walking about the open pavement
between the seats and the buildings, who gave a favorable
indication of the physical characteristics of the better class
of men. A very fine equipage, with a white driver in livery,
stopped near the seat we occupied, and a gentleman and
lady, with their daughter, as we supposed, alighted from it, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>dressed with much neatness and even elegance. They passed
through the fancy confectionery store below, and ascended
to the upper story of the building, where ice-creams, &#38;c.,
are served in magnificent style to visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very seldom that a Brazilian lady is seen upon the
streets of Rio during the day, which is in part to avoid the
scrutiny of men, and perhaps, also, to obviate the embarrassment
of seeing those same men under circumstances
not very becoming for observation. The heat of the sun
during the day is likewise doubtless a reason why the
women remain within doors, and they find the temperature
of the night air more pleasant for exercise. The number
of ladies from other regions of the world, that are now residing
in Rio, is beginning to make some changes in the
habits of the sex; as English women or French women go
out upon the street whenever business or inclination calls
them to take a walk or a ride in the city. The custom here
has been that of great seclusion among all classes as to
their women; but the more intelligent and refined Brazilians
are learning that a different course is the true policy
for the promotion of the true character of woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had no means of knowing whether the party referred
to were natives or foreigners; but their style indicated refinement
and good taste. Their carriage was of the most
fashionable make, with accommodations for four persons
within, and a broad front seat for driver and footman. The
upper part of the body was of open cane-work, and the entrance
on either side wide, so as to give a light and airy appearance
to the vehicle. The livery of the driver and footman
was of blue cloth, with silver lace upon the collar, and a high,
slick hat of enamelled leather with a band of silver. The
team in this instance, as in most of the fine turnouts of the
fashionables, was a pair of fine mules; and really these slick
and lively animals, being of full size and well proportioned,
present here a better appearance than horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>This promenade is one of the few places of resort for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>those who do not go to the theatre and opera; and though
there is a hotel and an ice-cream saloon here, there is no
special entertainment for the numerous visitors that come
and go in the course of an evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as I have been able to learn from others, balls and
parties of a public character are not frequent in this city;
and indeed the whole constitution of society is opposed to
this kind of promiscuous assemblage of the sexes.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several large establishments for theatrical performances,
and also opera houses, suited to the different
classes of people. The Emperor considers it a matter of
sufficient interest to sustain and patronize these places of
recreation, and I am informed that he frequently attends in
person accompanied by his family. His object is doubtless
to promote what he esteems the happiness of his people,
and not from any idea that they will be thus diverted, so as
to prevent their minds from being directed into mischievous
channels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pacific character of this people, and their great
proneness to adhere to an existing state of things in all the
departments of life, with their general admiration for the
noble traits of the Emperor, affords a guarantee for the stability
of this empire, independent of its constitution and
laws.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Friday</span>, <i>September 15, 1865</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I called this morning, with Mr. Mallory, at the office of
Major Pedro Latão da Cunha, Secretary in the Naval
Bureau, to whom he presented his testimonials of qualification
for service in the Ordnance Department. This gentleman
speaks the English language, and seems to take
considerable interest in promoting his wishes. He advised
him to draw up an application to the government, setting
forth his former services, and what duty he desired to enter
upon here, and proposed to present it with his recommendation
to the Minister of State.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Upon making an inquiry as to the practicability of being
employed in the Hospital Department as a surgeon, after
completing my investigations in the country, he expressed
a favorable opinion; and stated that it would be desirable
that I should draw up a paper indicating the nature of the
public service in which I had been engaged, and the position
I would like to occupy here.</p>

<p class='c007'>He proposed to take this likewise in his special charge,
and to use his influence to advance my wishes. It had not
been my intention to make an application for any position
under the Brazilian government at this time; but since
this gentleman manifests such an accommodating spirit, I
may find it convenient to undertake for a time some duty
connected with military hospitals, near the seat of war, and
thus see something more of the country towards the south.</p>

<p class='c007'>After closing this interview, I repaired to the store of
Mr. G. N. Davis, and he accompanied me to the office of
Senor Don J. C. Galvão, No. 23 Rua Dos Ciganos. This
gentleman also speaks English very well, and received me
with great respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>He heard my statement of the projected move of myself
and my friends to Brazil with evident interest; and exhibited
to me maps of the country, with records of lands
owned by the government, and also descriptions of improved
farms of private parties, which were offered for sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The price of public lands ranges from twenty-two cents to
eighty-eight cents per acre, to those making an independent
purchase. To those without the means of buying land, or
of supporting themselves separately, one hundred and fifty
acres of land will be provided, under the regulations of the
government, in one of their colonies—to be paid for at the
rate of one dollar and thirty-three cents per acre, one-third
at the end of two years, one-third at the end of four years,
and the last third at the end of six years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The family are to be furnished with agricultural implements
free of charge, and to be allowed one dollar a day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>for six months for each adult, with transportation from Rio
to the colony free of cost. As yet there has been no advance
of funds by the government of Brazil to bring emigrants
from the United States to this country; though a
small proportion of the outlay for transportation of emigrants
from Europe has been borne, with a view to assist
those who would not otherwise have the means of getting
to Brazil. There is already, in Rio, an establishment to
which those without means are sent to be lodged and
boarded free of expense, until they can be forwarded to a
colony. In these government colonies roads are opened,
houses of small size are built, and churches, schools, priests,
and a director are provided; but if it is the desire of the colonists
to furnish their own schools and churches, it is not
here prohibited; yet, if the churches are other than those
of the Roman Catholic religion, they cannot be built with a
steeple or other ostensible indication of a house of worship.
Mirabile dictu!</p>

<p class='c007'>I stated to Dom Galvão that there were many people
of good standing in the southern portion of the United
States, who were able to provide land and the means of
subsistence for themselves, and yet would find great inconvenience
in affecting the transportation across the ocean,
unless some systematic means of assistance could be devised
by the Brazilian government. There will be also persons,
doubtless, desirous of coming to Brazil, whose means are
very much reduced, and yet their former associations in
life would render them desirable companions to those having
more resources; and if those without means could
receive the assistance extended to the colonists by the
government, and yet be allowed to join their friends in a
settlement of their own, it would materially facilitate their
location in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Brazilian government will render the same aid to
our emigrants who are without means that has been extended
to her own colonists, it would find at the end of six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>months that all further outlay or responsibility was unnecessary;
and these people would co-operate with those having
resources, to build up and make useful all the industrial
enterprises of the settlement.</p>

<p class='c007'>To furnish lands at the lowest practicable rate, and construct
public highways, without any duty upon importations,
are at present proposed by the government of Brazil,
as encouragement to emigration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dom Galvão proposed to represent my views upon the
subject of emigration to the Minister of Agriculture, and
expressed his conviction that some practicable scheme
would be devised to effect our object of being associated
together, under regulations that would be satisfactory to
all concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Davis called with me also to see Mr. Milford, Acting
Consul of the United States, by whom I was courteously
treated, and informed that a large body of land had been
intrusted to his charge, located near the Dom Pedro II. railroad.
He stated that papers were in his possession giving full
particulars of its nature and resources, and that they might
be seen by calling at his office, No. 28 Rua Del Alfandega.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was then presented to Mr. James, No. 15 Rua da
Direita, and had a conversation with him as to the settlement
of Dr. Blue and others, near the Bay of Paranagua.
He informed me that Mr. Wells, of St. Louis, had gone on
a visit to that locality, and was expected to return in a few
days, when all available information might be had from
him. I had requested Dom Galvão to make arrangements
for me to visit that region, but no further steps will be taken
until I hear the report of Mr. Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some private interests involved, which have
enlisted parties as advocates of the lands in the vicinity of
the Bay of Paranagua; and I doubt whether it is desirable
to look at a country where those expecting to speculate in
lands have already made investments with a view to sell
again.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Learning from Mr. James that Mr. Wells had returned to
the city, I accepted his offer to give me an introduction to
him. He gave me the particulars of the bay, and the river
extending up from it, with an account of the recent settlements
near that place, conveying rather a favorable idea of
the surroundings of the Bay of Paranagua; yet I found
that he was not so favorably impressed as to think of
making his home there.</p>

<p class='c007'>I concluded accordingly that it would not perhaps suit
as a location for me and my friends; and that the advantages
of other localities would be investigated without
visiting this place at present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having heard from several disinterested persons that the
province of São Paulo combined fertility of soil and adaptation
especially to the culture of coffee, with a pleasant
and healthy climate, I was inclined to think very favorably
of that region. Upon an examination of its outline on the
map it was found that it extended sufficiently towards the
north to afford all the tropical fruits, and that its southern
limit would secure a mitigation of heat, without being exposed
to much frost during the winter, lying between 19° 38′
and 25° 39′ south latitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these circumstances I withdrew my application for
transportation to the Bay of Paranagua, and asked Dom
Galvão to arrange for a visit to the province of São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been down to see me, and not finding me in, had
left a paper, embodying modifications of the regulations
pertaining to emigrants, which are intended to carry out
my views. Upon having this document, written in Portuguese,
translated by Mr. Hagins, it did not seem very definite
or satisfactory, and I will confer with the author in
person, when we meet again on Monday at his office. Then
I will get more precise information as to the points submitted
in this paper, and can determine whether any practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>benefit is likely to accrue from the acceptance of his
propositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mallory and myself were expected at the office of
Major Pedro Latão da Cunha, at 11 o’clock a. m., but,
failing to have the papers in readiness, we did not reach
there until after 12 o’clock, when he had left, and we were
fully conscious of our dereliction. As we returned, however,
he hailed us from the opposite side of the street; and
on speaking with him, we found that he had been to learn
the cause of our failure to meet him. This made us notice
the great importance of promptness and punctuality in
keeping our appointments with officials. He proposed
that we should call at his office on Monday at 12 o’clock,
when he would go with us to see the Minister of State, and
endeavor to have our applications acted upon forthwith.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though there is no special consequence attached to the
disposition that is made of mine, it is of great moment to
Mr. Mallory to get a speedy and favorable response to his
application.</p>

<p class='c007'>My understanding with different parties as to matters of
business, indicates that I may, in a short time, ascertain
definitely something as to the lands that may be available;
and learn further my future relations to this government.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In compliance with a previous understanding, Mr. Mallory
and myself went immediately after breakfast to Captain
Buhlaw’s quarters, on one of the highest hills in the city,
whence he and his wife accompanied us to the museum.
This visit was made to-day, as we were informed that it
was open only upon Sundays.</p>

<p class='c007'>We examined a very extensive collection in the departments
of Ornithology and Herpatology, with a fair assortment
of minerals, of which the specimens of native diamond
engaged my special attention. There was a very interesting
variety of coins of different nations, and also some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>specimens of paper money, among which I observed a one
dollar ($1.00) greenback note, and others of smaller
denomination of the United States currency. These certainly
have very little claim to a place among coins, except
as curiosities.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the collection of fishes, I observed a very badly-prepared
specimen of flying fish, and were it not for the great
interest my friends will take in one preserved by me on the
voyage across the water, it might be presented to this
museum, so that the characteristics of this truly remarkable
phenomenon could be appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the various specimens of cotton, those from the
United States had precedence; yet there are several samples
of cotton grown in Brazil which are nearly as good
as those grown in the Southern States, and with proper
culture this staple will doubtless be still more improved,
as the climate is thought to be well adapted to its production.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was quite a number of very fine specimens of
coffee, the best of which were marked as being produced in
Brazil. There is a great difference in the appearance of the
samples from various sections of this country; and this
goes to confirm the idea that many brands of coffee receive
their names from the merchants here, or at the points to
which they are imported. Persons of fastidious taste may
thus have Mocha, Java, Laguayra, &#38;c., &#38;c., all coming
from Rio, and yet leave a larger proportion to bear the
appropriate name of this place. I know from personal experiment
on one occasion, that deception in this respect is
not difficult. Three specimens of coffee—the Mocha, Java,
and Rio, so called—were all served in my house to a
party of friends, and the vessels containing each specially
noted by my wife. After the experiment of each, all the
party concurred in pronouncing that which was known only
to her to be Rio coffee as the best of the three; and were
quite surprised when told that they had overlooked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>supposed fine qualities of the other specimens. If they
had been informed in advance what name was borne by
each pot of coffee, doubtless the antipathy to Rio coffee
would have manifested itself by condemning this article.
But not knowing the quality contained by either of them,
the verdict was rendered according to their real taste; and
acting upon the suggestion, a bag of this was purchased,
that proved to be really excellent coffee. I have met
an Englishman here who says they don’t drink Rio coffee
in London, and yet I am told that large cargoes are shipped
to England.</p>

<p class='c007'>After concluding our observations of the cabinet specimens,
we made a tour of the general and special curiosities
that are here gathered from all parts of the world. Several
Egyptian relics in the form of mummies are here exhibited,
and various antiquarian souvenirs from Pompeii<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>places of historic fame. Many very showy garments used
by the Indians of this country in by-gone days, and their
implements for the capture of game, or for purposes of
war, were presented for our examination and admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was quite interested in an immense living eagle, that
attracted attention by frequently uttering a most harsh
squall; and while other specimens of large birds show
what they have been, this affords a present exemplification
of vigorous animated existence. From the remnant of a
chicken seen in the cage, I infer that the daily bill of fare
is quite costly.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the museum, I went with Captain Buhlaw
and his wife, in an omnibus, out on the line of railroad
towards Tijuca, for a distance of four miles, and saw along
the way many things of interest. This seems to be the
most desirable portion of the suburbs of the city for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>residences of private families, whose business does not
confine them to the more densely populated streets. There
is much taste displayed in some of the buildings and
yards, and several really elegant improvements have been
recently completed. The dwellings have, for the most part,
large gardens attached, with a combination of the useful
and ornamental, in the plants and shrubbery, rendering
them quite attractive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The majestic palm tree is seen standing in quiet dignity
amidst the more unpretending and yet more useful growths
of orange, banana, mamon, and the ajaca. This valley, lying
between the mountain ridges on either side, is a level plain,
with a clear stream of water running throughout its entire
length. Much of the territory is not yet built up, and the
lots are offered for sale by posting placards upon them,
with the Portuguese words, Vende—se. This precinct is
to the city of Rio de Janeiro what the vicinity of Central
Park was to New York before its improvements were completed;
and the day is not far distant when this route to
Tijuca will become the most charming residence around
the city. The soil seems to be well suited to the growth
of vegetables, and I observed that they were receiving more
systematic culture here than elsewhere, being grown,
doubtless, for the market.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the line of railroad to the small retreat of Tijuca is
merely for the accommodation of persons residing there,
and along the route, it affords most convenient and prompt
transportation at stated hours, and thus makes the distance
a matter of small moment to those living in this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having learned that there would be preaching to-night at
the Episcopal church, which is the only service in the English
language in the city, I got directions to the place, and
Mr. Mallory and I set out in search of it. By the use of
an extemporized phrase of Portuguese, “Onde está Ygreza
Ingliza?” I was enabled to find the house of worship. The
service had already commenced when we arrived, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>gave an entirely orthodox exposition of the plan of salvation.
The minister urged the acceptance of the Lord Jesus
Christ, as our Saviour, upon all who had not yet laid hold
of the promises of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving a land of Protestantism, and coming into
this Roman Catholic country, it is very refreshing and edifying
to be once more associated with Christians who hold
the same great cardinal doctrines of faith with myself. This
building is a plain substantial meeting-house, with none of
the outward show of a church, and the interior presenting
a neat but unostentatious appearance. There was quite a
peculiar arrangement of the pulpit, at a considerable distance
from the rear wall of the house, and elevated so as to
require a sort of stairway for the ascent of the minister.
The congregation was small, but consisting of genteel-looking
persons; and, from their physiognomy, I concluded
them to be chiefly English people, and certainly none of the
Portuguese race. The minister impressed me very favorably
by his simplicity of manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding that Mr. Mallory has been raised as a
Roman Catholic, he remarked that this form of worship
was more in accordance with his views of Christianity than
the parade which he observed in the Catholic churches of
this city; and that he expected to attend service with the
Episcopalians, at this church, during his stay here. I find
that none of our Catholics seem to have a favorable impression
of the piety of their brethren of the church in this
city; and they, consequently, manifest no inclination to
hold fellowship with them in their ostentatious worship.</p>

<p class='c007'>The demonstrations witnessed to-day in Rio show an
utter disregard for the solemnity of the Sabbath. A large
body of volunteers in holiday uniform, with a band of thirty
musicians, were encountered early this morning upon one
of the principal streets. In the next place, quite a number
of soldiers, with their guns, badges, and flags, were seen
assembled in a most gorgeous church, for the celebration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>high mass. This ceremony was conducted with great pomp
by the priest, and a large number of dignitaries held lighted
candles of most enormous proportions, forming a concourse
around the altar, which again was lighted up by hundreds
of candles, though it was in open day, with a clear bright
sun shedding its rays on all who would enjoy the light
which God has given.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we went in search of the English church this evening,
we found a large assemblage of persons in a public garden,
drinking in groups at tables arranged for the purpose,
while a band was entertaining the party with music, from a
stand erected for their special accommodation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately adjoining this garden was a building, in
which a circus was performing, and we could hear the applause
and laughter, such as might be expected at a farce
or comic exhibition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day seems to be regarded rather as a holiday for
amusement, and yet many of the business houses are kept
open during the Sabbath, and there is no law of the country
requiring its observance as a day of rest from labor, or to
be kept holy to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great many of the people attend mass in the forenoon
of Sunday, and then join in any recreation that may be
presented. It seems that the theatres and opera houses
regard Sunday evening as specially suited to attract a large
number of persons, and usually have their most attractive
pieces on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In returning to-night from preaching, a large assemblage
of negroes was observed immediately upon the side of the
street, and, upon entering the building, we found it was a
church for the exclusive use of the black people. Here
many were kneeling in front of the altar, while some service
was held by one of their own color; and, at a side
stand, there was another black personage, who furnished
applicants with a small printed paper, upon the payment
of two coppers of the value of four cents. Mr. Mallory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>said these were no doubt indulgences for some sin committed,
and the trade seemed to be going on prosperously.
There were no seats in this building, and those who did
not kneel sat flat upon the floor, as I have observed to be
the case in all the services, when they did not stand. The
churches do not have seats, and perhaps there is no regular
discourse delivered to the congregations in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as I am able to infer any thing of the spirit manifested
in their acts, I should regard the religion of the
people in Rio as having very little of the holy unction, and
the natural tendency of a State establishment is that of
formality.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after breakfast this morning we called upon
Dr. Bosworth, who had been at our quarters on Saturday
without seeing us. He desired to apprise us of an appointment;
that Major Pedro Latão da Cunha would accompany
us to-day at 12 o’clock to visit the Minister of State. Of
this we had already been apprised by the gentleman in
person, and at the hour specified we proceeded with him
to the large public buildings where this minister receives
audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Buhlaw having also an application for public
service, accompanied Mr. Mallory and myself, and was
included with us in the kind offices of presentation to
Conselheiro Saraiva, the Minister of State for the empire
of Brazil. Next to the Emperor, he is the highest dignitary
of the land, and in his absence at the seat of war, this
official takes charge of matters that are intended for the
special consideration of the Emperor. We were received
by him with every mark of attention and consideration;
and the interview terminated with an assurance that each
of us would receive the appointments as desired.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> He said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>farther, that our applications were favorably considered,
not so much from any demand for our services, as that the
empire of Brazil wished to extend this recognition and
appreciation of our motives, in coming to this country as
a place of residence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prompt and definite hearing given to our respective
claims impressed me very favorably with the business character
of the minister, and his courteous manner lead us to
entertain a high regard for him. Pursuant to a prior appointment,
I called at the office of Mr. Milford to-day, to
examine the papers pertaining to a tract of three thousand
acres of land, lying near the Dom Pedro II. railroad, and
within an hour’s run of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The
price twenty-four thousand dollars, which makes it eight
dollars per acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>The place is represented as being under cultivation in
rice and sugar-cane, and as having a fair outfit of farming
implements, with cattle, for a limited sphere of operations.
It is represented as adapted to the culture of coffee, cotton,
corn, sugar-cane, and rice. I am further informed, by
another party, that it is an old plantation very much exhausted,
and every thing very much out of repair, so that
it is not likely to meet the expectations which the glowing
description in Mr. Milford’s hands is calculated to induce.</p>

<p class='c007'>We called upon Mr. James E. Crenshaw, formerly of
Richmond, Virginia, at the Exchange Hotel, during the
afternoon, and had a very pleasant social interview with
him. The past and the present of the South was discussed
and considered, in regard to the future of our people in the
midst of the circumstances by which they are surrounded.
He said that he had been written to by many of his friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>while in England, representing the many difficulties of their
situation; but he had not been able to give them any advice
as to the course it would be best to pursue at present.
It would afford him much satisfaction to know what are the
inducements presented to agriculturists in the interior of
this country, and he requested me to inform him as to the
result of my investigations.</p>

<p class='c007'>We took a stroll this evening into the fashionable and
showy business mart of Rua d’Ouvidor. This name implies
a street of hearing, and was given originally from
being the location of the courts for hearing and deciding
litigated cases. It is, however, at present the street for
seeing, and, with the ladies, for being seen. As those of
elegance and refinement usually select the evening to do
their shopping, this brilliantly illuminated thoroughfare
affords the most favorable opportunity for an inspection of
the better class of women. They may be seen making purchases,
in the finely furnished store-rooms, or looking in
upon the rich show-windows from the side-walks. These
gaudy windows are not only supplied with extra gas-lights,
but have mirrors on the outside, reflecting the dazzling
brightness upon the articles for exhibition, and the glare is
almost equal to the light of the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>My limited opportunity for seeing the ladies of elegance
does not warrant the expression of any opinion as to their
general appearance; but it is fair to infer, that some of
those seen at different times and various places present the
common characteristics of the sex; and there has been a
marked deficiency of beauty on the part of those coming
under my observation. I must allow, however, that they
dress with good taste. There seems to be a partiality for
black with ladies, as well as gentlemen, in this city; and
both sexes are entirely free from that display of rich colors
which is said to be characteristic of the Spanish people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gentlemen and ladies here manifest no disposition to
ostentatious display, and yet seem to have a just appreciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of neatness and even elegance in their attire. The
high-crowned slick beaver hat, which is vulgarly known
among us as “stove-pipe,” is the usual head-dress of the
Brazilian gentleman; and indeed this style of hat is generally
worn by the respectable business men of the city.
A slouch hat, such as is worn by business men in the
United States, is not often seen here; and, though the panama
hat is used by those who travel or go much in the sun,
I have not seen a single specimen of what is called the tropical
hat. In lieu of this cool and very appropriate style
of hat, all persons who go out upon the street carry neat
silk umbrellas to protect them from the sun, and to be used
also in case of rain. An umbrella seems to be the “vade
mecum” of a gentleman here; and if a friend finds you
without an umbrella when going out from his house, he
insists upon loaning one to you, so that it becomes a matter
of courtesy to others to supply yourself with this accompaniment
of almost all classes of men. This serves as a
good and useful substitute for the walking-cane, or the riding-whip,
so frequently carried needlessly by our people.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Tuesday</span>, <i>September 19, 1865</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This day has been devoted to looking round the city, and
becoming acquainted with some of the prominent localities,
in this extended area of widely-diversified scenery.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are quite a number of conspicuous elevations within
the corporate limits of the city, which are now occupied by
private dwellings, and are considered the most desirable
localities for families, both in regard to health and the
pleasant breeze which reaches them, while the air below is
close and warm. In the bay there are several islands, which
afford desirable homes for families likewise; and on the
margins of the water, around the borders of the city, there
are many little nooks which afford quiet retreats from the
stir and confusion of the business thoroughfares of the city.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Botafogo and Praia Grande are among the most notable
of these, and the former is especially captivating for private
dwellings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Across the water again is found the abode of numerous
persons doing business in the city, besides constituting the
residence of a considerable population, who belong to the
place, and remain there permanently in various industrial
occupations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Receiving an invitation from Dr. Raney, the chief of the
Ferry Company, to take a ride with him on one of the boats,
we crossed the bay to the town of Nitherohi; and learned
that this was entirely distinct from the city of Rio, being
the capital of the province of Rio de Janeiro, and having
its own independent municipal regulations. San Domingos
constitutes an adjunct to this, and is the seat of numerous
factories of cigarettes, while it is a most attractive home
for private families.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two landings, at which these boats stop, and
the number of persons getting on and off, morning and
evening, are almost equal to that of the New York and
Brooklyn ferry boats. There is not, however, such a continuous
passing during the day and night, though a single
boat finds profitable employment until 12 o’clock at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fee for ferriage during the day is six cents. This is
doubled from dark until 9 o’clock, when it is again doubled
until 10 o’clock, and from this until 12 o’clock the last is
doubled, making the fare fifty cents. Thus persons who
keep late hours, attending theatres, balls, or parties in the
city, are taxed with extra fare to return to their homes, and
it must have some effect towards inducing men to remain
with their own families during the evenings.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is an interesting fact that these boats, being similar to
the double-enders of New York, should have been brought
across the ocean from the United States by their own engines;
and though they were in a gale, and got separated
on the way, they suffered but little damage, and reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>here in good condition for service. Besides the two that
steamed out, there was a third brought upon the water, by
a temporary rigging of sails. The whole was superintended
by Dr. Raney in person, and indicates much energy and
business capacity on his part. There is another boat, which
was purchased in Rio, and has been remodelled so as to
suit this special service, but it is not yet ready to go upon
the line of the ferry company.</p>

<p class='c007'>The daily receipts on this line of ferry boats are not
usually less than four hundred dollars, which no doubt
covers the wear and tear, with interest on the capital, and
leaves a large net income. Yet the payments required for
putting every thing in thorough order has prevented large
dividends to stockholders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Corcovado mountain is the highest accessible point
around the city, and having a road to its summit, the visitor
finds there seats for his comfort, and enjoys a view of
all the surroundings of the city. Upon the slope at the
foot of this mountain is a country which is resorted to by
the curious, and presents many elaborate works of art,
mingled with the beauties of nature, to grace the last resting-place
of man’s frail body.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most conspicuous features of the populated
portion of the city is the signal telegraph at the observatory,
upon the elevated Morro do Castillo. Here, a flag pole with
arms and cords, for the attachment of various signals, stands
in bold relief above the busy throng of people; and when a
vessel is seen to approach from the ocean, such flags are
raised as indicate to all the initiated what is the character
of the vessel, and from whence she comes, usually two or
three hours before her arrival. Upon this hill is also located
the military hospital, which has the reputation of being a
remarkably well-regulated establishment, for the treatment
of those connected with the public service.</p>

<p class='c007'>The monastery is a very extensive structure located upon
the Morro San Antonio, and, being far above the ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>haunts of the population, affords the monks comparative
exemption from any of the annoyances of their fellowmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the Morro de São Bento is located the convent,
for the accommodation of the Sisters of Charity, and here,
I am informed, quite a large number of nuns are congregated,
as a place of perpetual seclusion from the snares
and temptations that are supposed to beset the sex in this
sinful world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the elevations of celebrity, either for their public
occupation or as the residence of persons of distinction, are
the Morro da Gloria, Morro do Senado, and the Morro do
Livramento.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Rome is known as the city of seven hills, this designation
might also be most appropriately applied to Rio de
Janeiro, as her hills are the greatest attractions of the
place, affording a delightful variety of scenery. Leaving
the heights we may descend to the plains, and note some of
the public establishments of most interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the central portion of the broad level plain, upon which
the business population of Rio is located, the Quartel des
Municipals Permanentes is found, with all the structures
and conveniences for administering the affairs of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The public offices of the ministers and officials of government
of the empire are situated upon the western border
of an open space, called the Praca de Acclamacão, or the
Campo de Santa Anna. On the south side of this space is
the neat and yet modest-looking Congress Hall of the deputies
of the empire. On the north side, in connection with
the densely populated portion of the city, stands the large
museum, of which mention has already been made at a
former date. The street running to the east of this campo
has upon the opposite side a large number of stores, with
several buildings, in which there are apartments for the
public officials of the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the middle of this grand plaza stands a large opera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>house, which is the great resort of the common people
throughout the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>This magnificent piece of ground, commonly called the
campo, lies quite unimproved as yet; and the washerwomen
of the vicinity congregate here to use the fountains
of water with which it is supplied, and to spread out their
clothes upon the green grass that covers its surface. It
will ere long receive the attention of the authorities, and
be laid out in walks and decorated with flowers and evergreens,
and must become a very attractive resort for the
pent-up population of this metropolital rendezvous of all
the nations of earth. It is only recently that much interest
has been manifested in ornamental public grounds, and
the Botanic Gardens, with other more central spots of land,
already show the taste of a progressive administration, in
beautifying and adorning the rural loveliness of nature by
the chaste hand of art.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most elaborate improvement to be seen in the city of
Rio is the exquisitely executed equestrian statue of Dom
Pedro Primeira, which stands in the middle of the Praca
da Constituicão. The first Emperor is represented in full
military costume on horseback, and with the scroll of the
constitution raised aloft in one hand, while the other grasps
the reins of the bridle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pedestal has upon its four sides, respectively, four
pairs of Indians, with animals and reptiles, representing
the regions named upon the corresponding faces. This portion
of the structure has inscribed upon it, likewise, the
principal rivers of the empire, arranged with relation to the
localities indicated; and thus affords a historic picture of
the country, with its geographical features, brought into one
interesting group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The base is made of neatly-hewn granite, and comports
admirably with the massive elegance of the whole device.
There are two small reservoirs of water, with a “jet d’eau”
at some distance from the statue, upon each side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>square; and the artificial vines and foliage, with colored
flowers, look so true to nature, that persons are very prone
to suppose they have grown in the water. The grounds
are laid out with excellent taste, and enclosed by a neat
iron fence, giving an air of completeness and uniqueness
that is eminently becoming to the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this handsome testimonial to the first
Emperor indicates that he had endeared himself to his people,
so as to make them feel pride in honoring his memory,
yet his policy was so contrary afterwards to the wishes of
his subjects, that he was under the necessity of abdicating
his throne, and left the country to end his days in Portugal.</p>

<p class='c007'>His lineal descendant, the present Emperor, succeeded
him, and entered upon the exercise of his high functions,
having a regent to officiate in the performance of the responsible
public duties of the empire at the outset, and subsequently
administering all his business with the most enlightened
regard for the interests of his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be a source of painful reflection to every Brazilian,
in looking upon this statue, to think that the original
could not be sustained by the people who had placed him
in authority, and though, like Washington, he may live in
the hearts of his countrymen, his grave rests not upon his
own soil, as that of the great North American.</p>

<p class='c007'>A communication was received quite unexpectedly, yesterday
evening, from Dom Antonio Paula Sonsa, Minister of
Agriculture, inviting me to meet him this morning, at ten
o’clock, at his house, number nine, Rua da Joanna.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking a hack, I proceeded to his residence at the time
specified, and, upon entering, quite an awkward scene ensued,
as neither understood the language of the other, and
there was no interpreter present. Making an attempt to
converse in French did not relieve our embarrassment, as
my stock of the language was too limited to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>or to make myself understood in that tongue. At length,
he wrote, at my suggestion, in French, that a gentleman
who spoke English would arrive shortly to act as interpreter.
Understanding this, I took a seat, and remained
quietly until the interpreter came. Our intercourse being
now made easy, he desired to know my views and wishes
in regard to the measures that might promote the emigration
of my friends to Brazil. I told him that the object of
visit was to look for a home for my own family, and to
make an examination of the country, with a view to report
the result for the information of other families, whose unfortunate
situation in the South induced them to desire a
change of residence, and, in like manner with myself, hoped
that a desirable location might be found in this country.
He expressed a great desire to encourage the class of people
to whom I referred, and said that he would take the matter
at once into consideration, and devise a plan for assisting
those who were desirous of coming to Brazil from the
Southern States.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time, he proposed to render me all the aid in
his power for a thorough examination of the country; and,
as I had already concluded to visit the province of São
Paulo, he informed me that a ticket would be furnished me
to go by the steamer to-morrow to Santos, and that he would
supply me with letters to the President of the province, and
to other influential persons in different parts of the country.
He told me that passage would be furnished likewise to an
interpreter, if one could be secured, and that he would provide
in like manner for any friend I might desire to accompany
me on the expedition. He further stated, that under
his direction to the President of the province, all the requisite
facilities would be afforded to me by him, for my exploration
of the lands lying in the interior of the province,
and expressed a wish that I might find there a suitable location
for myself and my friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>I learned in the course of the conversation that the minister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>comes from the province of São Paulo; and, therefore,
perhaps he feels more interest in giving encouragement to
an investigation of that region, than if my examination was
directed to some other quarter. My predilection for this
locality being entirely independent of any partiality on the
part of the minister, I will yet gladly avail myself of the
advantages which may accrue from this fact, and with the
offer of assistance in making a thorough exploration, I will,
for the present, suspend all further action in regard to an
appointment in the Hospital Department, and devote myself
to this examination of the lands and resources of this
fertile province.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentleman who acted as interpreter is the secretary
of the Minister of Agriculture, and it was understood that
he would bring to-morrow morning, to my quarters, the
letters and other papers with which I am to be provided
for making this tour of examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ticket for passage upon the steamer was given to me
to-day; and all the necessary indorsements and stamps put
upon my passport at the treasury and police offices. I can
now proceed with my personal preparations for getting off
to-morrow, and will notify Major da Cunha of my leaving,
so that he may take such steps as he may think proper, in
regard to the paper which was to be prepared for the other
mission. No calculation can be made as to the length of
time I may be engaged in the examination of these lands,
and my intention is to make a full report of all my observations,
as a guide to my friends and others who may be
interested in the resources of this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The residence of Senor Dom Antonio Paula Sonsa,
Minister of Agriculture, is in the precinct of São Christovão,
and near the palace of the Emperor, where his family reside.
But my pressing duties did not admit of any delay to visit
the royal abode, and I must reserve the privilege of paying
my respects to his majesty for a future occasion. I feel,
however, no special inclination to wait upon the Emperor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>unless business should require me to see him, and his time
and patience are doubtless sufficiently taxed here with visits
of mere formality. As he is absent at the seat of war just
now, all the matters of business that would have taken me
to see him will probably be disposed of by his ministers,
and there will be no need to see him.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the way to São Christovão, I passed the grand butcher
pen of the city, which monopolizes the slaughtering of the
cattle for the market. It is a large establishment, with
spacious grounds, and a high cast-iron fence, having a gate
of huge proportions with portals of hewn stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a tannery connected with, or adjacent to, this
slaughtering establishment, and the large number of hides
are thus turned immediately into the vats of the tanner.
This place, called the “Cortuma de Mello e Sonza e
Campo,” is represented as being a very fine combination of
appliances for treating the hides in all the different stages
of tanning, using the bark and leaves of native trees for the
supply of ooze, by which the leather is tanned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though I could not stop to examine this tannery to-day,
I was delayed opposite the gate of the slaughter-house, contrary
to my wishes, for the driver of the diligence to blow
up passengers for the return trip to the city, and received
the above general report in regard to the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conductor of this diligence used a brass horn to give
the signal for departure and stopping, and when approaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>a point where persons were expected, he blew continuously
until the spot was reached; or if there was not a full
cargo present, the bugle was used vigorously, as in this
place, to hurry up all who might desire to take seats. Some
of these omnibuses are fully entitled to the name, as they
carry everybody with their families, being suited to the accommodation
of forty persons at one time. I took a seat
upon the outside, where I could see the various points of
interest presented by the slopes of the mountain side and
the improvements on the plain below.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having completed my personal arrangements for setting
out this morning to São Paulo, a very puzzling difficulty
arose, by the failure to get my papers from the Minister of
Agriculture, and, for a time, I thought of postponing the
trip. It occurred to me, however, that the letters could be
forwarded by mail, and as my passage was secured for this
steamer, I took a row-boat, and paying one dollar for myself
and baggage, was soon aboard of the Santa Maria
steamer.</p>

<p class='c007'>We remained at the anchorage nearly two hours after the
time appointed for leaving, and upon stopping at the police
station for examination of papers, I was pleased to find my
friend Job, who had been sent by Mr. Davis, with the package
of letters and documents from the Minister of Agriculture.
The boatmen took advantage of this express service
to charge two dollars and a half for bringing Job down,
which, however, I paid very cheerfully, as the papers were
very important to accompany me on arrival at the city of
São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>My passport was examined by the police officer and returned
to me, whereupon I secured my berth, and made
myself quiet for the voyage to Santos.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Santa Maria is a steam packet with two masts
arranged for sails, and having side-wheels, with her aft deck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>covered by an awning, so as to make this position very
pleasant for passengers. Her eating-saloon is large and
airy upon the first floor, and the apartment, with spacious
state-rooms, is below this, and has large ports by which the
ventilation is effected very satisfactorily. Though each of
the state-rooms has four berths, I, fortunately, had an entire
state-room, which, rendered my passage very pleasant. My
impressions of the general construction of this steamer,
and her adaptation to the accommodation of passengers as
well as freight, are decidedly favorable to the progress of
Brazil in the art of building vessels. Though her engines
are of English make, I am informed that all the work of
constructing this steamer was done in Rio de Janeiro; and
she is not only substantial and well-modelled, but finished
in all her parts with good taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>The management of those in charge of the Santa Maria
looks to the cleanliness and neatness of every thing, and
the bedding was found in excellent condition, while the fare
was of good quality and very well prepared. All the regime
of the packet was satisfactory to me, and yet there are some
proceedings at the table which seem unnecessary, and especially
the change of plates for each different article that is
eaten. Those who desire several things upon a plate at the
same time, indulge their taste of course; and as variety is
the spice of life with me, I paid but little attention to the
rule observed by most of the Brazilians, in making frequent
changes of plates at breakfast as well as at dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The demonstrative character of this people is strikingly
illustrated at their meals, as each man calls out for any
thing not within his reach, or even rises to his feet and
reaches over the table for what is wanted by himself, or another,
at a distant part of the table. Every one is expected
to supply himself as far as practicable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Persons who concluded their meals, and did not care to
wait for those seated on the bench upon either side of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>crept under the table, and made their way out at the opposite
side, where there was no wall to be encountered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wine is an invariable accompaniment of dinner, and
after all is concluded, it is the custom to serve coffee without
milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The custom of this country recognizes but two meals a
day—breakfast being from eight to nine o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, and
dinner from four to five o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> But it is usual to
have a cup of coffee upon rising in the morning, and a cup
of tea, with crackers or fancy cakes, is taken at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tea is generally taken for breakfast by the Brazilians,
and when I made inquiry at the breakfast table for a cup of
coffee, it had to be made before it could be furnished. The
cups here are exceedingly small, holding but little more
than an ordinary wine-glass; and the coffee or tea is made
strong in an increase ratio to the size of the receptacle,
which suits my taste very well, as I have no fancy for long
coffee, by which term the Brazilians style it when very weak.</p>

<p class='c007'>My isolated position among strangers, whose language
was unknown to me, was relieved by meeting aboard Senor
Antonio de Barros, to whom I had been introduced at the
house of the Minister of Agriculture. He speaks English,
so as to carry on conversation very well, though he seems
to be impressed with a sense of his deficiency in the use of
the language. I found him quite kindly disposed, and in
all respects a gentleman. He assisted me in making known
my wants at the table, and on other occasions, giving me
also a correct pronunciation of the few Portuguese words
which I had acquired for necessary purposes. He proved
to be a very genial and intelligent associate during the voyage,
and gave me important items of information in regard
to the province of São Paulo, in which he resides. He is a
brother-in-law of Dom Antonio Paula Sonsa, the Minister of
Agriculture, and his father is Baron of Rerecicoba, so that
his associations are the best of the land. Having received
his education as an engineer in Germany, he speaks that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>language and French as well as his native tongue, the Portuguese.
His knowledge of English has been obtained from
teachers and reading, without any opportunity of associating
with people speaking the language. Under these circumstances,
I was surprised that he should have so good a
pronunciation and conception of the English language.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a young Portuguese aboard of the steamer
who also spoke some English, and manifested a disposition
to assist me in getting a vocabulary of Portuguese words.
His pronunciation of English, however, was very defective,
and frequently I could not understand what he attempted
to say to me, which made our intercourse rather embarrassing.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a sleight-of-hand operator on the vessel, who
afforded considerable entertainment by his tricks, with a
small ivory ball and a cup or stand with a cover, in which
this and other articles would be placed and removed at will,
without any one being able to detect the process.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our steamer kept in sight of land throughout the entire
route, and occasionally passed between an island of rock
and the shore, giving a fine view on each side.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After a late breakfast, most of the passengers repaired to
the deck, where comfortable seats were arranged for their
accommodation. The atmosphere was quite cool, and with
a brisk wind, I felt as if my overcoat would be acceptable,
but being interested in the scenery I did not care to go
below for the purpose of getting it, and I walked to and fro
upon the deck, so as to keep my blood in active circulation.
I was, perhaps, the only man who did not smoke, and most
of them were using the cigarettes made of the corn husk,
containing tobacco, which are very much in use here by all
classes of people. In the Portuguese language this is called
cigar, while our article of that name is called cherotte. The
snuff is ordinarily called tobacco here, and the article for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>chewing fumo, thus changing all our terms in the Portuguese
language.</p>

<p class='c007'>We approached the harbor of Santos shortly after ten
o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, and the low flat land upon our left, forming
a part of the large island upon which the city stands, was
in striking contrast to the towering hills upon our right
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fort, which is intended to guard the entrance to the
harbor, is upon the mainland on the right as we approach.
It is a rude stone work of small dimensions, with guns of
small calibre in barbette, which would not prove effective in
arresting a vessel of war that might attempt to move upon
the city. This antiquated-looking fort was evidently constructed
prior to the advance in fortifications, which has
been made in the last quarter of a century. It is not such
a work as should be relied upon by a nation actually at war
with a power which has shown much reckless daring and
considerable enterprise. All are aware that a vessel of the
Brazilian government was captured by the Paraguayans,
in the very commencement of hostilities, and that they have
had armed vessels of war upon the waters, which might
leave the immediate scene of operations, and make an attack
at other more vulnerable points. It is to be hoped, however,
that the determined policy of the Emperor will soon
bring this war with Paraguay to a successful close.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon landing at Santos, I found a city that resembled in
many respects the business portion of Rio, and having in
the store-rooms large supplies of coffee and cotton. The
streets are somewhat wider than those of Rio, but there is
less activity in every department of business, and all the
people looked as if there was plenty of time to accomplish
whatever they had to do. Some of the buildings near the
wharf have quite an antiquated appearance, and are doubtless
remnants of the early settlement of this place, which
was among the first of the country. Near this city is the
famous São Vicente, where Martino Affonso founded the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>first colony that landed from Portugal, in 1532; but the
port has become obstructed by sand, and it remains an
insignificant village.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having a letter from Dr. Henry C. Bosworth to Mr. W.
T. Wright, of Santos, I proceeded to his business house,
where he received me with respectful cordiality, and kindly
invited me to his residence. I informed him of my expectation
to proceed at an early hour next morning, and that it
would be preferable to retain my quarters at the Hotel de
Millen, where my baggage was ordered to be left. His
invitation to take dinner, and make the acquaintance of his
family, being accepted, he despatched a young man to see
that my trunk reached the hotel in safety from the steamer,
while we engaged in conversation as to the aspects of affairs
in the South. He has been a modern advocate of our cause
during the struggle, and sympathizes with us in our misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c007'>My visit to the family of Mr. Wright was marked by
such kind consideration, as to make me feel like I was
again amongst old friends. His wife is a native of this
country, but speaks English fluently, and has few of the
characteristics, in person or manner, of the ladies of Brazil.
They have two rosy-cheeked little boys, with fair complexion
and sprightly dispositions, who seemed to regard me
as one of the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was much interested in looking around his very extensive
grounds, and had an opportunity of tasting the guava
fruit from which the favorite jelly is made. Here I saw,
for the first time, the coffee tree bearing berries; and the
prospect for a fair yield was favorable, though the trees had
not received the attention requisite for the best result. The
berries are at first green, then red, and afterwards black;
the exterior capsule including two grains, with their flat
sides in opposition. The tree bears some resemblance to
the crape myrtle, and the berries are arranged in clusters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>along the small branches, from which they are stripped
with the hand when ripe, as indicated by becoming dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon I joined Mr. Wright in a ride upon
horseback, across the level flat land lying between his
place and the beach. This ground is covered with a low
scrubby growth, and the soil has the appearance of being
well adapted to the growth of rice, and perhaps also of sea
island cotton.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the vicinity of Santos, rice has been produced more
successfully than in any other portion of Brazil; and if
these lands could be brought into successful cultivation,
their near proximity to the city would not only afford a
ready means of disposing of the crop, but various articles
might be procured to improve the soil for the production
of other articles. Along the beach there are several neat
private dwellings, with gardens attached to some of them,
which present a very thriving aspect of all the ordinary
vegetables. In the premises of one gentleman we saw
also a very pretty variety of flowers and fancy shrubbery;
and having a neat iron railing, the place presented quite an
attractive appearance. These situations being some two miles
from the city, with a good sea-breeze, and a very fine sandy
beach in front, of several miles in extent, are the most desirable
homes for families who have the means of indulging
this retreat from business associations.</p>

<p class='c007'>After returning at dark from this ride, I accompanied
Mr. and Mrs. Wright to the house of a friend, where a
small party was expected; and though I acted as escort for
Mrs. Wright, my arm was not tendered to her as would
have been expected with us, from the fact that I had
learned nothing as yet of the habits and customs of society
in this country, and had the general impression that the
association of ladies with gentlemen was much more restricted
than in the United States. At this place I had an
opportunity of seeing a specimen of the social parties of
the city; but was, of course, unable to hold any conversation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>except as Mr. Wright interpreted between me and the
gentleman of the house. Accordingly I felt that my presence
was likely to prove irksome to all parties, and just as
tea was announced, I excused myself at the risk of appearing
rude, and went to look after matters of business, which
were more in accordance with my inclination at this time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wright accompanied me, and presented me to Senor
José Vergueiro, who resides in the interior of the province
of São Paulo, and has the largest and best arranged coffee
plantation in the country. He stated that it would afford
him great pleasure to aid me in examining the lands of the
province, and that he would cheerfully accompany me to
see different plantations in his own neighborhood. He informed
me that business engagements would necessarily
detain him at Santos for several days, but that he expected
to proceed to the interior within a week, and should I leave
prior to that time, he would write in advance of going, so
as to secure me a proper reception upon visiting his place
and others in that section.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was furnished with a letter by Mr. Wright to an uncle
of his wife; Senor João Bernardino V’ra Barboza, at São
Pedro, in this province. He has lands to dispose of himself,
and will be able to refer me to others having large
estates that may be for sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon parting with my newly-acquired friend, Mr. Wright,
whose hospitality I enjoyed, he insisted that, on my return,
I would make his house my home, in true southern style.
Appreciating the spirit of his invitation, I of course accepted
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wright tells me that he has received some account of
the lands and water facilities at a small town upon the
coast, called Conceicão, which makes him suppose that it
might be a matter of interest for me to visit it. When I
return to Santos, he thinks that he can accompany me to
see this place, and advises me not to make any definite
arrangement elsewhere, until I examine that locality.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Santos has a good harbor, and sufficient depth of water
for vessels of any magnitude. It is located upon an extended
plane, which admits of indefinite appropriations for
buildings; and, with a full supply of excellent drinking
water, from the adjacent elevated grounds, there are presented
favorable conditions for a larger city at no distant day.
The railroad line already connecting this city with the city
of São Paulo, and in process of completion farther into the
interior, will facilitate very much the transportation of
products to this point; which will afford a market, or be
the medium of communication with Rio de Janeiro. Should
the emigrants from the United States locate in the province
of São Paulo, this city, being the principal seaport, will
become the centre of trade, and must grow rapidly in all
that pertains to business.</p>

<p class='c007'>After my voyage through the country is completed, I
may give my attention to the examination of some of the
improvements of this city, which cannot be noticed now.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this place, I may remark, that any extended travel in
Brazil is styled a voyage, though it be entirely upon land.
In the account of the tour upon horseback, made by the
Emperor recently, across the province of Rio Grande, to
the seat of war, it was spoken of in the <cite>Anglo-Brazilian
Times</cite> as voyaging through the country.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Having enjoyed a comfortable night’s rest at the Hotel
Millen, I awoke at the early hour of 5 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> with
the sound of a pelting rain and howling wind. This precluded
the thought of making an early move, as had been
anticipated; but I got a cup of coffee, and held myself in
readiness for any notice from the diligence. When the
weather gave some promise of improvement I ventured out,
and learned from the man having charge of transportation
that it would be impracticable to take a boat to the foot of
the serra as he had expected, but that horses would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>provided and our baggage could be forwarded in carts. I
ordered breakfast in my best Portuguese vocabulary, and
got it somewhat in advance of the regular hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>All things being in readiness, we set out about 9 o’clock
<span class='fss'>A. M.</span> for the diligence station, which was some eight miles
distant, at the foot of the serra. Senor Barros and myself
were on horseback, while his brother-in-law, Dom Barros, and
sister were in a chaise with two horses, the extra animal
being attached by a swingle-tree at one side of the shafts.
The driver was seated flat in the foot of the chaise, with his
legs out at one side, and urged his team forward at a good
speed over the rough turnpikes. We reached our destination
about 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, and at this point we entered a
substantial vehicle, styled here a diligencia, intended for
seating eight persons. There being but four of us, and a
small boy besides, we had ample room, and sufficient space
for the bandboxes also.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the outset, seven horses were attached to the diligence,
and a driver on foot took charge of those in front,
while one on the box drove the four others that constituted
the regular team. On the lesser slopes, and the occasional
level portions of the road, we went at a sweeping trot; yet
this pedestrian driver ran along with us at great apparent
ease until we reached the ridge of the serra, making a distance
of six miles. He then detached his three horses,
which had been driven abreast in front, and took them
back to the station, while we proceeded with the four-horse
team upon a finely-gravelled road at a rapid gait.</p>

<p class='c007'>The steep ascent of this mountain side is made by a zigzag
road, which is cut from the slopes of the cliffs, and
paved with stones. At some places there are precipices
descending suddenly from the edge of the road to great
depths, so as to make the traveller feel serious apprehensions
for his passage along the rather narrow track of the
road. I was told that mules have been sometimes forced
over these abrupt edges into the awful gorge beneath, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the crowding of a large number into these narrow places,
and their utter destruction is of course inevitable. There
has been no instance, however, of any accident to the diligencia,
which run this route from day to day; and hence a
sort of guarantee of safety is afforded by this mode of
conveyance, which is not felt upon the newly-constructed
railroad line, which ascends the serra by inclined planes
and stationary engines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deep gorges in the sides of the mountain have
streams of water running from the more elevated parts, and
in one of these recesses there is a cascade of much grandeur
and sublimity. From the side of a cliff covered with
green foliage, this stream seems to gush forth, and dashing
downward with the greatest impetuosity from one ledge of
rock to another, it finally goes surging and boiling through
the mountain gorge, to form a tributary to the river below.
I could not so far restrain my utilitarian ideas, as to keep
out the impression of the immense water-power that might
be wielded by this bold stream, were it situated at a favorable
point for the erection of machinery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhat more than half way up the slope of the serra,
there is a most enchanting view of the broad expanse of
land and water around the city of Santos. Rarely does it
fall to the lot of man to occupy a position more favorable
for enjoying that fine contrast of mountain and plain, which
is presented in casting the eye upwards along the crest of
the serra, and then downwards over the placid and yet
varied scene beneath, with the ocean seen in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The variegated green foliage which envelopes the slopes
of the serra is a type of nature’s loveliness, and we may
truly say of this grand panorama that “Beauty unadorned
is most adorned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Between Santos and the foot of the serra, nearly a thousand
mules were encountered, laden with coffee, cotton and
other products of the interior, going towards the city of
Santos. Though I did not count those which were passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>after getting into the diligence, it is a fair estimate that
an equal number were met after leaving the station. Thus
we have about two thousand pack-mules, each carrying
about two hundred and twenty-five pounds of the products
of the country, making their way to Santos. Going in an
opposite direction, there was perhaps an equal number, that
had delivered similar articles, and were now laden with
various kinds of merchandise for the consumption of the
people in the interior; or in some instances with pieces of
machinery for the improvement of their industrial appliances.
In one instance, a mule was carrying two immense boxes,
which literally covered it from head to tail.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is much to be desired that this bungling mode of
transportation will ere long be supplanted by the opening
of the railroad line from Santos to São Paulo. It is said
to be already completed; yet an accident upon the line, on
the occasion of a trial excursion some months since, has
perhaps served in part to induce the contractors to retain
the use of the road exclusively for forwarding the necessary
articles of construction for the portion of the line not
yet finished. Not only is the demand great for the transportation
of freight, but there is now a considerable amount
of travel, which must at present avail itself of the diligence
line and submit to all the exactions they see fit to
make. I was told that the fare from Santos to São Paulo
was fifteen millreas, ($7.50;) but in addition to this there
was a charge of four millreas ($2.00) for a horse to ride to
the foot of the serra, and a charge of three millreas ($1.50)
for the transportation of baggage, making together twenty-two
millreas, ($11.00.) The extras can be put on with the
monopoly of the means of transportation, but if we had
the line of cars upon the railroad, it would not only be
cheaper, but more expeditious, though from present indications
the safety of the railroad seems very problematical.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the small village of São Bernardino, about half way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>from Santos to São Paulo, there are two very neat-looking
tea farms, which succeed as I am informed in producing a
very good article of tea. Really this is like an oasis in the
desert; for there is scarcely another redeeming feature in
the route from the serra to the city. If my estimation of
the resources of Brazil had to rest upon the soil along this
road, I should take no interest in locating here.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ground in one particular locality was raised in
mounds of various size, from that of a potato-hill to the
extent of earth thrown up in burying a horse. This resulted
from the operations of a species of ant called here
copina, and if the soil had been fit for any thing previously,
it would be rendered useless by the presence of these insects
in such immense numbers, as the entire surface for a
considerable area was covered with these hills of different
proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this copina, there is another species of ant, called
formica, which is very destructive to vegetables throughout
this region. They burrow in the earth, at such depths, and
by such circuitous channels, as to render it impracticable
to destroy them except by fumigation with sulphureous
gases, or other poisonous exhalations, that may be blown
with an air-pump or by a bellows into their dens. This
class of ants is said to be very troublesome in the agricultural
districts of this province, and they are perhaps the
greatest obstacle to the success of the planters in the
cultivation of cotton, to which they are particularly destructive.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Notwithstanding the unpromising aspect of the lands
generally, through which we travelled, we had a fair assortment
of substantials for our dinner at the hack station,
and especially was there a good supply of the staple commodity
of the country, feijão, which is a variety of beans
somewhat similar to our corn-field bean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our lady friend, who had been absent for some four years
in France, had not perhaps enjoyed an opportunity during
her absence, or since her return, to avail herself of the
native feijão; and I was quite interested to observe the
evident relish with which she partook of these beans.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our route to-day we encountered a vestige of former
days that is still in use in many rugged parts of the country,
called the banquet.</p>

<p class='c007'>It consists of a sort of box, as the body of the carriage,
having shafts at each end, so that a mule may be placed in
each, to bear the burden. With this firm and apt support,
one mule having his tail to the body, and the other with
his head towards the other end of it, progress is made
successfully over the most irregular and narrow roads.
Women and children are placed in this box-carriage and
travel to any part of the country in comparative comfort
and safety, and should any portion of our people go far
into the interior, this is the mode of transportation which
must be relied upon for families, as carts and wagons cannot
travel over many of the roads in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached São Paulo after dark, and I proceeded to the
Hotel de Italia, and was pleased to receive the salutation
of the landlady in my own language. She sent a servant
with me to search for Mr. Preller and Mr. Sampson, to
whom I had letters of introduction, but neither of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>was found, and after returning, I went to my room. After
sleeping until after midnight, I was awoke by the sound of
music and voices in the house, and I could recognize the
voice of our landlady, in the midst of others, speaking in
an excited and elevated strain. Being kept awake for two
hours, this did not seem in keeping with an orderly establishment,
and I concluded that my landlady was quite too
fond of company and late hours to suit my taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>The humiliating confession must be made, that I had not
noted the return of the Sabbath, and went out this morning
for the purpose of doing some shopping. There was
no indication in the business aspects of the streets that it
was a day of rest, and it was only brought to my mind
that I was violating this holy day by a remark of my landlady
referring to the day of the week. I only bought,
however, Vieyra’s small Portuguese and English Dictionary,
which is in two volumes, so that one may be carried in
each coat pocket, and be ready for use whenever a word is
needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. D. H. Sampson was found this morning at the Hotel
da Europa, and my letter from Dr. Thomas Rainey, of Rio,
being presented, he expressed his satisfaction upon making
my acquaintance, and manifested a readiness to aid me,
which was quite gratifying. He suggested that it would
be more pleasant for me to move round to this hotel, as I
would find more persons here speaking the English language,
and with a view to introduce me to his friends he
invited me to dine with them to-day at the Hotel da
Europa.</p>

<p class='c007'>As my experience at the Hotel Italia was not calculated
to attach me to that establishment, I concluded to change
hotels, and closed my account.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the morning I made the acquaintance of
Mr. Newton Bennaton, who is a Brazilian that spent several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>years at school in Maryland, and speaks the English language
as well as the Portuguese and French. He seemed
at once to take an interest in the object of my visit, and
offered to render me any assistance that lay in his power.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We were received with the customary courtesy, and it
was soon brought to my attention that this same gentleman
owned a large and fertile tract of land at some distance
beyond Campinas, which he would either sell or lease. If
it was desirable to lease land under cultivation, he would
be willing to rent a quantity of open land at sixteen millreas
($8.00) per acre. We had nothing favorable to expect from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>this source, and accordingly thanking him for his tender of
assistance, we took our leave of this honorable gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was next presented by Mr. Bennaton to Senor Antonio
da Costa Aquiar, who is an intelligent Brazilian that speaks
the English language fluently, and it was arranged that he
would accompany me to see the President of the province.</p>

<p class='c007'>We accordingly proceeded to call upon his Excellency,
Illm. Senor Idão da Silva Carrão, President of São Paulo,
at his palace, which by the way was found to be rather
unostentatious in its exterior, and simply neat and plain
within. My letter from the Minister of Agriculture was
delivered, and I learned that a private letter had also been
received by the President from the minister in regard to
my visit. The President indicated his disposition to give
me all the requisite aid for exploring the province of São
Paulo, and the interview closed, with the understanding
that I would receive an audience next day at eleven o’clock
<span class='fss'>A. M.</span> for the consideration of details.</p>

<p class='c007'>My reception here partook more of a simple business
character than any previous meeting with the officials of
this country, and it appeared to be viewed by the President
and by Senor Aquiar as intended solely to accomplish an
object. The attention of the President was evidently very
much occupied with business which other parties brought
before him, and several were in waiting when I was admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>His demeanor was respectfully courteous, and his general
appearance was intellectual and dignified, while the characteristic
attitude of the man of business was maintained
throughout this rather brief interview with me and my
interpreter.</p>

<p class='c007'>My friend, Mr. Sampson, left the city to-day for his place
of business on the railroad at Cachoeira, and placed me in
charge of his room, with the key of his trunk, and authorized
me to use any thing in it that might render me service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>until my baggage should arrive by the cart of the diligence
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already I had accepted his offer of a shirt, and now
availed myself of another, which was needed. My baggage,
however, came to hand this evening, and there will
be no further necessity to resort to my friend’s trunk,
which is well stocked with all needful articles. Upon leaving,
Mr. Sampson informed me that he would have a negro
man, who spoke Portuguese and English, in the city with
a mule during the week, and should no satisfactory arrangement
be effected with the President, that I could come
up with this man to his place, where I should be equipped
for my tour.</p>

<p class='c007'>He proposed to get some one to accompany me, as interpreter,
in communicating with the people of the country,
and to provide animals for the expedition, for all of which
I feel very grateful.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, coming here, as I do, under the authority of the
Minister of Agriculture, who represents the government of
Brazil in this department, and bringing a letter from him
to the President of the province of São Paulo, in which he
is directed to provide the requisite facilities for examining
the lands of the province, I must look to him for the means
of proceeding. It is only when he may fail to do what is
expected of him that I can consistently avail myself of
this or any other tender of assistance from private individuals.
My mission must have the sanction and indorsement
of this public functionary to make it what is evidently
designed by the Minister of Agriculture, a government
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being now a boarder at the Hotel da Europa, and not a
guest as yesterday, at the table of those speaking the
English language, I may without impropriety allude to the
demonstrative proceedings of the party at breakfast and at
dinner to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had I not known that this party were drawn together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>by kindred feelings, as well as the same tongue, it might
have been supposed that an open rupture was imminent, in
hearing their impeachment of each other, and their apparently
angry retorts upon one another.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest confidence in their mutual good will constituted
the key to these quasi violent assaults based upon
supposed offences; and the actions being suited to the
words, it is highly probable that those not understanding
their kindly relations might infer a state of things very
different from the reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addressing the servants, who knew very little of
English, the harshest language was sometimes used; while
the most threatening attitudes and gestures were occasionally
accompanied by casting a piece of bread at the head
of a negro. It seemed to afford a sort of recreation to
worry the black servants, by talking and acting in a way
that was not understood by them, and especially when their
slow movements or other shortcomings met their disapprobation.
This table is spread in a room separate from the
main dining-saloon of the hotel, and it is therefore a sort
of private apartment where they are at liberty to do as
they may be disposed without any stint.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is not so much changing of plates with this group
of friends as is customary with the Brazilians; but they
indulge in all the variety of articles and in the different
kinds of drinks that the country affords, and really live
upon the fat of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the day, I was introduced to the Rev. A. L.
Blackford, who is a Presbyterian missionary from the
United States to this papal dominion of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>He manifests quite a cordial interest in my object and in
my personal welfare. This feeling was doubtless enhanced
by learning that I held a like faith with him; and he
called upon me in the evening and took me to his home, to
make the acquaintance of his wife. With a full appreciation
of my reception, I felt that my lot was cast with
friends, whose house was open to me at all times.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a conference with Mr. Bennaton, this morning, I
learned from him that it would suit him very well to accompany
me as interpreter on the proposed tour of the
country, and that he had already intimated his readiness to
go if a satisfactory compensation would be allowed by the
President.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we started to visit the President this morning, I
suggested to Senor Antonio Augusto da Costa Aguinar,
who accompanied me, the propriety of providing for the
expenses of Mr. Bennaton as interpreter, as well as the
employment of a camarada to take charge of the animals
which would be required for the voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the conference with the President, the
question was propounded to me as to what compensation
was expected by Mr. Bennaton; when I replied that he
had not communicated to me the terms upon which he proposed
to accompany me. The question was then asked, if
I thought he would be satisfied with three hundred millreas
($150) per month; when I stated that it was not perhaps
a matter of pecuniary consideration with Mr. Bennaton,
and that he would doubtless be disposed to accept
whatever was thought proper under the circumstances to
pay him.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was pleased to learn from Senor Aguinar at the close
of the audience, that there was a prospect of having every
thing arranged for my outfit; and after returning, I informed
Mr. Bennaton of what had occurred, with the request
of Senor Aguinar that he would call at his office in
regard to the details of the arrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not seem satisfied to undertake the trip upon the
terms proposed; and after meeting Senor Aguinar, he had
an interview with Senor Dom Bernardo Gavão, who proposed
to confer with the President in reference to the compensation
of Mr. Bennaton and the other provisions for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>expedition. I can do nothing but remain quiet, and let
them work out the matter among themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rev. A. L. Blackford came to my room this morning
and invited me to make his house my home while I
remained in the city. While it was entirely agreeable to
accept his hospitality, I told him that Mr. Sampson had
kindly placed his room at my disposal, and that there were
reasons connected with my business engagements that
rendered it better to retain my present quarters. He left
with the understanding that my meals would be taken with
his family, and I accordingly notified Mons. Planet, of the
Hotel da Europa, paying him five millreas ($2.50) for the
accommodation of his establishment for one night and
three meals of victuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon repairing to the residence of Mr. Blackford, at
4 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, I found dinner in readiness; and the cosy
quiet trio, which he, madam, and myself made, around the
circular table, was quite in contrast with the stirring scenes
around the hotel table. Of course this retired situation
suited my tastes better, and I felt really quite satisfied in
my associations with this pleasant family. Though the
gentleman is from Ohio, and the lady from Pennsylvania,
there seems to be no political prejudice against the course
pursued by the South, on the part of either; and indeed
Mr. Blackford has sympathized with us in the recent struggle
to resist the incroachments upon our constitutional
rights by the Federal Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner, we took a walk to the botanic garden,
which was quite a recreation, though there is very little
evidence of that culture which is requisite to render the
place attractive. There are several pieces of sculpture,
and among them a Venus and an Adonis; but none of them
impressed me favorably as specimens of art or copies of
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>It being Mr. Blackford’s custom to hold family worship
at 8 o’clock in the evening, I proceeded with them to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>lower apartment of the house, where the servants and some
other inmates of his premises joined us in the service.
He read and sung in the Portuguese, giving me an English
and Portuguese Testament, in which I had no difficulty in
following the reading of the chapter. The principal prayer
was in English, but he closed with the Lord’s prayer in
Portuguese, thus adapting the exercises to my want of
knowledge of the language of the country, and also in part
to the comprehension of the others present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Dom Bernardo Gavão had a conference this morning
with the President of the province of São Paulo, and it is
now understood that he will make the arrangement with
Mr. Bennaton on such terms as will be satisfactory to him
for his services as interpreter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was intimated to me that in the event of failure by
the President to meet the expenses of this exploration,
Senor Dom Gavão would probably advance the funds that
might be required to visit an extensive landed estate of his,
which is located near the town of Araraquara and this would
traverse a large portion of the province. I feel however no
misgivings as to the course of the President in regard to
this matter, as he is well aware that there is a public sentiment
in this province which would sustain him in any encouragement
given to the emigration of our people to this
region; and he has besides the authority of the minister in
appropriating from the provincial treasury whatever may
be necessary to facilitate my movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>My observation thus far is, that the officials of Brazil
are disposed to pursue a very enlightened policy respecting
the proposed emigration of the people of the Southern States
to this country, and I have far more apprehension that we
may be ultimately thwarted in our wishes by the interests
of private parties, than from any failure on the part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>authorities of the empire, or those of the provinces, to meet
our just expectations.</p>

<p class='c007'>I went this evening with Mr. and Mrs. Blackford to examine
the public bath-house, which has been recently fitted
up in elaborate style, and is now to be opened for gentlemen
and ladies at the rate of one millreas (fifty cents) per
bath. The marble bathing-troughs and the neat apartments,
with the refreshments provided by the proprietor,
will no doubt secure a paying patronage. But the price is
beyond the means of many who would like to indulge frequently
in a bath, and it is therefore likely to be rather an
aristocratic establishment. There is a frontispiece over the
entrance to the building representing a mermaid, (half woman
and half fish,) with the perfectly formed body and bust of
a naked female holding a harp in her hand and resting upon
the surface of waves that are very well delineated by the
artist. This is a subject of considerable criticism, and yet
really seems a very fitting prelude to the nudity of the
bathing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>My position in Mr. Sampson’s room is very convenient
for meeting those who wish to see me on business or otherwise,
during the day or at night; and Mr. Preller, to whom
I have a letter from Mr. Davis, spent nearly an hour with me
this evening. Upon leaving he gave me the assurance of
his readiness to serve me in any way that he could assist
me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving Mr. Blackford’s after dinner, a finely-dressed
gentleman from Rio Clara called there to see me,
and to represent the attractions of a coffee plantation which
he had for sale. He expatiated in most eloquent strains to
Mr. Blackford, but his valuation was far beyond our means.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>September 28, 1865</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Having a piece of gray cloth that I had brought from
home, and desired to have made into a suit of clothes, Mr.
Blackford went with me to the tailor shop. All the trimmings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>will be furnished, and coat, pants, and vest, made for
fifteen millreas, ($7.50;) and they will be in readiness upon
my return from the projected trip to the interior.</p>

<p class='c007'>We went into the large building used for the law school,
and saw one of the classes coming out of a lecture-room
with the professor, who was rather a young man, in his long
robe of black silk, flowing down to his feet. The young
men appeared very genteel in their deportment and dress;
and, for the most part, had arrived at full manhood. The
term of their attendance in this course of study is five years,
and if one does not come up to the standard required in the
examination, or has received a certain number of demerit
marks during the year, he is not permitted to graduate, and
has to remain another year. In some instances two extra
years have been spent, by those more fond of hunting or
taking their pleasure than of confinement to study.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am informed that there are five hundred students of law
in this institution, and that there is another school at Bahia
which has an equal or even greater number in attendance.
These are considered first class institutions, but I have no
means of knowing how they compare with similar schools
in the United States or elsewhere, and can only say that
the general standard of scholarship here is not equal to
ours, though the requirements of time are longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two monasteries in form and estate located in
this city; but there is only a single inmate as a monk in
each, which serves as a nest-egg, upon which those in charge
may perhaps incubate and bring forth some results; yet
the Brazilian government has interdicted the initiation of
any other monks. The property connected with these
organizations is said to be immensely large and very valuable;
consisting of lands and negroes in different portions
of the empire. But it is supposed they will be escheated
by the government, and thus these stigmas upon the face
of society will be obliterated.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several Catholic churches in this place, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>some of them of large proportions, but of very humble
and sorry appearance compared with the towering edifices
of Rio de Janeiro. The buildings here in the business
thoroughfares are much inferior to those of Rio, yet there
are some very tasteful houses and grounds on the border
of the city near the railroad depot. The plan of the city
is so very irregular as to mar its general aspects, and but
few fine equipages attract attention on the streets. One of
the greatest disadvantages of the city is the absence of
gas, and it indicates a want of enterprise or a spirit of
progress which should characterize the municipal authorities
of this refined and intelligent people. This being the
capital of the province, where many persons from abroad
are assembled annually, and being regarded a good climate
and healthy locality, it behooves those in charge of her
municipal affairs to take a step forward and supply the
streets with gas, and look to the correction of some other
palpable deficiencies in the present regime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very agreeable announcement has been made to me
by Mr. Bennaton that all the necessary provisions for the
trip to the interior had been arranged by the President,
and that he has already received seven hundred millreas
($350) to meet expenses on the way. The animals,
however, are represented as being in wretched plight, and
the camarada has not yet been secured to take charge of
them upon our journey. He expects to take two mules of
his own and his own servant, so that our outfit will include
at least six animals; two being required for pack-mules, to
carry our baggage alternately. It is his present expectation
that we will start on Saturday morning, and go up
that night to Mr. Sampson’s place at Cachoeira. But there
are contingencies which may prevent our leaving here before
Monday, and it will suit me better now to remain until
then, as I do not wish to travel on Sunday when it can be
avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had I known at the outset that our preparations would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>have been so much delayed, it would have suited me very
well to visit some places in the vicinity of the city, which
have been reported to me as having some interest for our
objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>One is a large landed estate belonging to the government,
that is occupied by the Baron of Itapitaninga, and
yet subject to the disposition of the authorities at any
time. But I take it for granted, there cannot be much fertility
in any land convenient to the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another place consisting of nearly a square
league of land, constituting a fazenda, called Bananal,
that lies some sixteen miles from the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, a larger territory at Bragança has been recommended
to me. But I can’t see them now.</p>

<p class='c007'>A pair of spurs and an umbrella have been procured to-day
to complete my personal equipment for the voyage;
and all is in readiness on my behalf for departure. It is
reported to me, however, that the arrangement as to the
animals and the camarada have not been consummated as
yet, and that we cannot leave to-morrow as was anticipated.
In view of this, I have intimated to Mr. Bennaton that
every thing can be arranged for our departure on Monday
morning; and it is now a fixed fact that we set out at that
time to enter upon the promised tour through the territory
of this province. I have much reason for congratulation,
in thinking that the officials in Rio de Janeiro, and also at
São Paulo, have done all in their power to promote my
object; and at the same time, I am gratified with the kind
spirit which has been manifested by a number of private
persons, who have expressed their readiness to serve me in
any way it might be acceptable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of the liberal provision made by the President
of the province for the defraying of all expenses of travel
and an interpreter, I have determined to send him a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of thanks, expressing my obligations for the same. It has
also appeared to me eminently proper that the public may
know that this favor is duly appreciated, and I will therefore
suggest that my communication be published in the
daily papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the notices in the newspapers at this place, and the
letters of introduction from various persons, with those of
the Minister of Agriculture, I hope to receive a favorable
consideration from the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>A ride was taken in the afternoon to the suburbs of the
city in company with Mr. Blackford. We passed the
Catholic cemetery, which is enclosed by a substantial and
very high mud wall, that is whitewashed, and presents a
very neat appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>In looking through the bars of the massive wire gate, I
observed several elaborate and costly vaults arranged on
each side of the way to the chapel, which seems to be
located near the centre of the grounds; and the evidence
of taste and attention was greater here than in most of the
structures for the living.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a Protestant burying-ground adjoining this
cemetery, but the rude mud wall, and the rough and uncared-for
aspect within, brings home to the passer-by that
this element is weak and powerless compared with the
dominant religion of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small resources at the disposal of Protestants are
more appropriately applied to disseminating the truth
among the people than in adorning a place for the dead,
in the proportion that the soul is of more value than the
body.</p>

<p class='c007'>A brickyard was visited, about one mile from the city,
which indicated more mechanical adaptation of means to
the end in view than is seen in most parts of this country.
A good substantial cast-iron mortar-mill, and a well-constructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>furnace for burning the brick, with an extensive
tile-covered shelter, rendered this establishment very complete.
The price of brick being here, however, forty millreas
($20) per thousand, will soon repay the manufacturer
for any extra expense in preparing to furnish them.
There are two other establishments for the making of brick
and tiles somewhat more distant from the city, and it is
likely that henceforth houses of much importance will be
constructed of brick, instead of mud walls, as heretofore;
though the exorbitant price, as yet, will prove a barrier to
their extensive use, and it would pay to make them on a
larger scale, at half present price.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little incident is worthy of record here, as illustrating a
phase of Brazilian life. Upon pronouncing my appreciation
of a very fine horse, rode by the owner of this brickyard,
as “Muito bonneto,” (very pretty,) he replied, “Está as suas
ordeus,” (he is at your orders;) which was explained by Mr.
Blackford to me in English, to mean simply that he was
gratified with the remark, and did not imply any expectation
that I would avail myself of the use of the animal.
This answer is very common when any thing is complimented;
and there is an anecdote told of a distinguished
gentleman travelling in foreign parts, who used a very costly
and elegant shawl. It was complimented by some one, and,
in return, tendered to the party, who accepted it as a present.
Another of equal elegance was procured by the gentleman,
and was again the subject of admiration, when it
was in like manner tendered and accepted. A third most
exquisite covering was now obtained with some considerable
difficulty by our tasteful and very polite connoisseur in
this department; and, upon presenting himself in society,
a friend was enthusiastic in his laudation of its elegance
and beauty. But, with the recollection of the past, the gentleman
apologized for not making a tender of it, with the
remark, that he had learned that it was the habit of people
there to accept what was offered, and having no prospect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>finding another to suit, he must be excused for retaining his
shawl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country around the city has a dreary, barren aspect,
and there is but little evidence of cultivation, except in
small patches or gardens, where manure is used to promote
vegetation, with only moderate results compared with those
of good lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wishing to observe the Sabbath as a day of rest, and, as
far as practicable, keep it holy to the Lord, it was my wish
and expectation to take no step to-day towards my projected
expedition, and supposed it was so understood by all
concerned. Yet I was informed by Mr. Bennaton this
morning that it would be necessary for the camarada to
start to-day with the pack-mules, so as to let them travel
leisurely, and reach the point in three days, to which we
would ride upon our better animals in two days. My baggage
was accordingly arranged, and the voyage initiated by
sending the pack-mules off in advance to-day, though we do
not leave until to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Portuguese service, at the residence of the Rev. A.
L. Blackford, was attended to-day by about twenty-five persons,
and though I could not understand what was said, the
gravity and apparent interest of the hearers impressed me
favorably. It was a mixed congregation of Portuguese and
negroes, several of whom have already made a profession
of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour, and become
members of the Protestant church, which is established,
in an informal way, under Presbyterian auspices, by
Mr. Blackford. He holds a meeting regularly every Sabbath
morning, for preaching, and one in the afternoon, for
a practical lecture and catechism exercise. Some of the
youths seemed to answer very promptly, and their manner
indicated considerable intelligence. It was very evident
that most of those in attendance at each service were from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the humbler class of society, and there will be great difficulty
in reaching the higher class of people with Protestant
doctrines.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the second service, we took a simple repast, such
as is the custom of the house on Sunday, and though there
was little cooked afresh, the supply of articles was quite
sufficient to meet all the wants of nature for nutriment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. and Mrs. Blackford then proceeded together to visit
some families where persons were inquiring the way of salvation;
and they informed me it was their custom to spend
every Sabbath evening in this kind of duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be hoped that their efforts may be blessed to the
enlightenment of the minds of the people, and to the salvation
of the souls of many who are now in the most hopeless
darkness. It really seems that this papal dominion induces
a worse state of the heart, in regard to holy things, than
the want of all religious instruction would be likely to exhibit;
and the form of religious services takes precedence
to holy living.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of my greatest difficulties, in proposing to locate
with my friends in this country, is the conviction that we
cannot so entirely set aside the recognized religion of the
government as to worship God according to our own faith.
It will, however, be an essential stipulation, that we shall
exercise entire freedom of conscience, without any interference
in our religious worship by the official authorities,
while our policy will be to detach ourselves as far as possible
from all associations with the papal element of the
population.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have brought these matters especially to the attention
of the Minister of Agriculture, and, from what I learn of
his general character for liberal views and high-toned, independent
action, it is reasonable to expect some definite and
satisfactory measure will be adopted through his influence
with the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Getting an early breakfast at the Hotel da Europa, Mr.
Bennaton and I started on our tour at 8 o’clock this morning.
I was mounted upon a gray horse of rather unpromising
appearance, that afforded quite a precarious reliance
for an extended journey through a rough country; but my
friend Sampson having returned to the city, made an
arrangement by which this animal would be replaced by a
mule belonging to his partner, Mr. Gephardt, upon our arrival
at Cachoeira. He likewise placed at my disposal a
McClellan saddle for the trip, and being accustomed to use
this style of saddle, I will gladly avail myself of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bennaton had two fine mules of his own, which he
expected to ride alternately; one being led by his servant
who was mounted upon a horse furnished by the President
for this voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped at an inn styled here “hospedana,” some
eighteen miles on our way, where we got a lunch of sardines
and mush made of farina, called here “angu.” Our
animals were also fed and rested for two hours, when all
being refreshed the travel was resumed. We reached
Cachoeira, the residence of Mr. Sampson, at 5 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>,
and just in time to take dinner with the party. Mr. D. H.
Sampson and Mr. Gephardt were left at São Paulo, but a
telegraphic despatch had preceded us, and we met a hospitable
welcome by Mr. S. Sampson and Mr. Dully, with
Dr. Clary, who was a guest in the house. The last-named
gentleman, like myself, has been identified with the movement
of the South, and has left the country with a view to
make his future residence in Brazil.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Early this morning I set out from the house with Mr. S.
Sampson to visit the tunnel which they are working for
the extension of the railroad from the city of São Paulo to
Jundiahi. It has already been opened entirely through,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>after immense labor in blasting rock throughout the whole
extent; and the work now consists in enlarging the space
overhead, by blasting the rock from the roof of the tunnel.
There is a temporary track with iron rail, and a mule-car
running from the work to the outlet, by which the loosened
stone is being discharged constantly. Yet there is a large
accumulation of boulders and irregular masses of quarried
rock lying near the scene of operations. This drilling of
holes overhead requires great accuracy in the striker; for
should he miss the head of the iron drill, the force of his
blow with the large sledge-hammer would be upon the hand
or wrist of the person holding the drill.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said, however, that accidents are rare, and when the
hammer glances from the head of the drill the injury is not
likely to be serious. This tunnel has a shaft running up
from the middle to the surface of the ridge; and some
months ago, while letting down four negroes, the cable
parted, precipitating them upon the rock beneath, by which
three were killed, and the fourth crippled for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>In entering the tunnel the darkness made a lamplight
necessary, and the roughness of the way, with here and
there puddles of water, rendered the use of a staff essential
to safe progress. It was quite cool in the tunnel, as a
current of air is circulating constantly through its entire
extent; and thus the large number of laborers employed
suffer no inconvenience. When this work is completed, all
the line to Jundiahi will be ready for laying the track
with iron.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road is already in running order from Santos to São
Paulo—a distance of forty miles—and when completed
from São Paulo to Jundiahi, there will be an addition of
forty-five miles, making a continuous line of eighty-five
miles. It is projected, and surveys have already been
made, to construct a further extension of the road from
Jundiahi to Campinas, a distance of twenty-six miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could I feel assured of the ultimate completion of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>line of railroad to Araraquara, it would enhance very
much the interest I will take in examining lands in that
remote territory which I expect to visit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our route to-day lay along the line of the railroad, and
I was forcibly impressed with the appropriateness of selecting
this region for a railroad, as it is most assuredly little
fitted for any thing else; and ought to be good for this
object, upon the principle of the man who recommended
his dog as a good coon-dog, because fit for nothing at
which he had ever tried him.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this land prove good for laying a track, the owners
ought to congratulate themselves that a portion of it can
be wrested from the copina and formica, species of ants,
which seem to have undisputed sway in most parts of the
territory through which we passed on our route to Jundiahi.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mounted upon the fine sprightly mule which was furnished
me at Cachoeira, I ascended and descended the
various elevations over which our route lay without feeling
any apprehension for my safety; and moving briskly,
we reached the inn of Senor Pinto, one mile beyond Jundiahi,
before 12 o’clock <span class='fss'>M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>After getting dinner we rode back to survey the village
of Jundiahi; and found that it had one rather comely-looking
church, with two others that presented quite a
dilapidated look. There was also a jail, at which a military
sentinel was on duty; and it perhaps contained some
of the patriotic recruits, who are taken in chains from
this section to São Paulo, and thence sent to Rio de Janeiro,
for service in the army against the Paraguayans.
We have met on the road a number of these fellows handcuffed,
and with a chain secured around their necks, under
a mounted guard, who seemed to think that they were
doing the country good service, from the large number in
charge of a few prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The architectural taste displayed in Jundiahi is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>likely to become a pattern for future builders, and therefore
I need not go into any special details; yet the fancy painting
around the lower portion of the fronts of the buildings
upon the street indicated that they were making progress
in the fine arts, and that the artists had simply made a
trial of their material here, preparatory to greater attainments,
when the arrival of the steam-engine may supply
them with a better model.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few small patches of coffee tree were seen near the
village which seemed in a thriving condition, and indicated
a yield far beyond what might have been anticipated from
the appearance of the soil. A change, however, in the land,
seems to commence near this place, and it assumes here
very much the aspect of red clay, but in some parts the
sandy soil predominating, and all lying very irregular, except
immediately upon the streams.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was impressed with the adaptation of the Jundiahi
river, a small stream which runs near our inn, for the location
of machinery of limited water-power; and when the
railroad reaches this place a good mill or cotton ginning
establishment would be likely to prove very advantageous
on this river. The fall is not very great, but could be
arranged so as to afford all requisite power for this or some
similar purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our quarters were so infested with fleas that I found it
necessary to rise in the night and denude myself, so as to
remove those that might be in my clothing. After this I
returned naked to bed, and wrapping up in the sheet closely
there was no further annoyance. This was an experiment
with me, and it succeeded so well that I commend it to
others when they may be thus unfavorably situated. The
dirt floors of this house, and the swine around the doors,
presented this nuisance; while our bedding and the outfit
of the apartments were in very comfortable order, and clean.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point we overtook our camarada and pack-mules,
which had been sent ahead of us. Getting a change of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>clothing from our baggage, the camarada was again sent in
advance, so that his mules would not be required to travel
as fast as we would ride. The train now consists of eight
animals, and the mule upon which I am mounted makes
nine, which is rather more than would be desirable to move
together. Our baggage trains, consisting of four mules,
two belonging to the camarada, and two of the government
stock, which are very poor and weak, requires to move
slowly, and can take more time by going forward while we
stop, either for repose, or the examination of places of interest
during the afternoon.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Moving off this morning at 8 o’clock, we proceeded about
fourteen miles, and halted at the house of a German for two
hours. This man had originally come into the country as
a colonist of the government, and getting a little means had
bought this place, paying fifteen hundred ($1500) dollars,
for three hundred acres, with a dwelling and other improvements.
Here the soil is evidently better than that
below Jundiahi, and seems to be well adapted to the growth
of corn and cotton. I saw here a specimen of the lint of
the pina tree, which is a beautiful, silky-looking fibre, as
white as cotton, and when mixed with it makes a beautiful
fabric; but it has not strength of fibre when used alone to
give proper texture to cloth. The pod is large and spherical,
growing upon a tree which is very large and tall, and
though the yield is generally abundant, the difficulty of
procuring the lint is so great that very little is gathered.
Eventually the pods fall to pieces upon the trees, and this
fine silky cotton is blown broadcast through the forests.
We got at this house a very good meal, consisting of Irish
potatoes, corn bread, beans, farina, spare ribs, fried eggs,
with a dessert of honey and sweet milk. Coffee was also
served after dinner, as is the custom everywhere in the
country, but I declined it, as all my available capacity was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>preoccupied by other things. After leaving this place, and
proceeding towards Campinas, we began to see the successful
culture of the coffee. The extensive plantations, extending
with the greatest regularity as far as the eye could
reach, presented a most attractive feature after passing the
dreary waste for two previous days.</p>

<p class='c007'>We saw at a point within two miles of Campinas some
negroes engaged in loading a huge oxcart with the crude
berries of the coffee, from an immense pile that had been
gathered from the trees growing along the side of the road.
The ground under the trees is raked clean preparatory to
stripping the berries with the hand, and an immense broad
flat receptacle made of the bamboo cane is placed under each
tree, but what fails to fall in this is easily swept up from
the smooth earth into a pile, and then taken up and put into
the receptacle. These are emptied into piles convenient to
the road, from which the coffee is hauled to the drying-yard,
where it is spread out and watched carefully to guard
it against rain. When dried it is submitted to a process
for taking off the hull, and then fanned to clean it more
thoroughly, or even by some submitted to cleansing by
washing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having turned off from the main road to Campinas, we
were accommodated with quarters at the antiquated-looking
fazenda of Senor Vicente da Sonza Queiroz, who resides
in São Paulo, and gave us a letter to his administrator at
this place, with the expectation that we would stop here
a few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>After being shown around the premises, Mr. Bennaton
and I walked through the back yard into the grove of orange
trees in the garden, where we found only bitter sweets that
were not desirable to eat. When we returned the old administrator
(another word for overseer) expressed himself
as not being satisfied with our going into the back yard
without notifying him, and there being two single daughters
on the premises was doubtless the cause of his concern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>about our visit. All these people, who have not been in
contact with the outside world, think it a solemn duty to
keep their females in great seclusion. It may be that this
old fellow was afraid we might get a peep at the girls, while
perambulating his back yard. They have not however been
seen as yet, and, unless affording a remarkable contrast to
the appearance of their father, it is not likely they will
afford much attraction to the gaze of the curious. With
every thing about the house of plain style, we are very
comfortably fixed, with a large airy room, and two sleeping-apartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coffee apparatus at this place is of the oldest and
most elementary construction, and therefore it may be appropriately
described in the outset of my observation. In
the first place the yard for drying is simply a firm smooth
surface of the ground, with a shelter at one side of it, under
which the coffee is carried in baskets, if there is a prospect
of rain. When this drying is completed, it is taken into a
circular box of perhaps fifteen feet diameter, and subjected
to the operation of a large wheel of wood, having a surface
of twelve inches, that rolls round in this circular box containing
the grains of coffee, and bruising or crushing off the
hulls as it passes repeatedly over them. This wheel revolves
upon a sweep or beam, to which oxen are yoked and move
on the outside of the ring, while the sweep is attached to
an upright post in the centre of the ring. After this slow
and bungling procedure has done its work, the coffee is
fanned or screened and afterwards a hand sieve is employed
with blowing by the laborers, to remove the fine investments
of the grain. That portion which it is thought
necessary to wash is now washed in large wooden troughs
by hand, after which another drying process completes the
preparations for market.</p>

<p class='c007'>I saw, at this place, that remarkable phenomenon, called
the Monjolo, and really was impressed with the simplicity
of this primary exemplification of the mechanical adaptation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of means to an end; but I could not restrain laughter
at the ludicrous display of see-saw motion which was kept
up every half minute. The apparatus, if it is entitled to be
dignified by that name, consists in an upright support for
a beam, which works by a sort of hinge upon its top, and
having at one end a pestle secured beneath it, that plays
into a mortar, while the other end of the beam is excavated
into a trough. The water pours from a small channel or
conductor into this trough, and when filled it becomes
heavier than the other extremity. This end is thus depressed,
while the other is raised aloft; and the slanting
position allowing the water to escape, there is no longer
sufficient weight to counterbalance the end having the
pestle, and consequently it descends forcibly into the mortar;
pounding, by its frequent repetition, whatever may be
placed in it. So soon as the level is again brought about,
of course the water again fills the trough, and it is again
depressed and emptied, keeping up a constant see-saw
operation, day and night, unless the beam is propped aloft,
and thus its motion arrested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fulfilment of that ideal principle of perpetual motion
is more nearly attained in this extremely simple mechanism
than by any machinery with which science has favored the
world; and though much more efficient means have been
devised, of accomplishing all that can be done by the Monjolo,
yet its ready adaptation, with a very small stream of
water, renders it useful in the hands of many, who cannot
employ other labor-saving appliances. It pounds coffee,
big hominy, farina, and would beat dough finely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breakfasting at Tapera, the fazenda of Senor Queiroz,
at which we were quartered, we mounted our mules, with a
servant upon another, and set out for the fazenda of Senor
Joaquim Bonifacio D’Amaral. The rest of our train was
left at Tapera until our return, and with a fine pasture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and plenty of corn, the stock ought to improve by the rest.
After riding something over four miles, with the assistance
of a guide we reached the large and really elegant establishment
of the gentleman above-named. Presenting the
letter which we bore to him, he gave us a reception which
assured me we would enjoy the visit, and the result fully
confirmed my anticipations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although I did not speak his language, yet he seemed to
communicate his spirit through the words reported to me,
and evidently thought and spoke with much intelligence.
While his bearing was dignified and refined, there was a
familiarity and simplicity in his manner that soon caused
me to feel easy in his presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>He ordered refreshments for us, and a large waiter was
brought by the servant with coffee, ale, and brandy; but we
only partook of the ale. I had taken coffee before breakfast,
and then café leite (coffee with milk) at breakfast, and
really had no mind for any further stimulant, but courtesy
demanded that something be taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>The parlor of Senor Bonifacio is spacious and furnished
very tastefully; but the plan of the house is marred by
having the small bedrooms, called here “alcova,” without
proper ventilation, and opening into the parlor. These are
also neatly furnished.</p>

<p class='c007'>A separate apartment was assigned to each of us, and
every thing furnished that could be desired. The beds were
particularly neat, the pattern of the bedstead being that of
the French style for a single person, and yet very capacious,
upon which lay spring-mattresses of the best quality, and
the whole covered with sheets and counterpanes of the
whitest hue and most tasteful pattern. The elegant earthenware
jug, or large bottle, for holding water to drink,
was in a plate of the same material upon the table, and is a
very convenient article that is much used here for keeping
the water cool, and, at the same time, free from dust that
enters a pitcher. A fine china bowl and pitcher were also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>at hand; and at night, a bathing-tub of metal, two feet and
a half across the mouth and eight or ten inches deep, was
brought in and filled with water, in which it was a luxury
to perform ablutions. This feature of every well-regulated
Brazilian dwelling is admirably adapted to the comfort of
the inmates of a warm climate; and yet, a large proportion
of the people here use tepid or even warm water for bathing
their persons or their feet, when cold water would evidently
be more pleasant and more invigorating.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new model of candlestick, with a glass upon it to protect
the light from the current of air in carrying it, was
used for our bedrooms, and, apart from being very appropriate,
was made of silver in the most tasteful style.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dining-room in this establishment, as in most houses
of the country, is very large; and, although the family-table
is perhaps fifteen feet long, a table of twice that length
could be accommodated in the room. Every portion of the
table-furniture was neat, and yet no special display in the
ceremonies of the table. The gentleman of the house was
seated at one end of the table, with his wife upon his left hand
and myself on his right, upon the opposite sides of the
table. There was neither ham, turkey, or fowl of any kind
for dinner, which in our country are considered essentials
to a well supplied table; and yet there was quite a sufficient
variety of articles to constitute an excellent dinner.
Roast beef and beefsteak, mutton, and pork were all served
in the most approved modes, and with a good assortment of
vegetables and a delicious dessert, the dinner was relished
very much. Wines of the finest quality were upon the
table, and coffee of superb make was served after all other
things were concluded. The combination of wines and
coffee seems to be an excess of stimulants in the routine of
dining in this country, and cannot be promotive of digestion;
but I relish very much the small cup of fine strong
coffee, such as we had here, and will fall into this habit of
coffee after dinner without any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>After dinner, we were furnished with horses of most excellent
saddle-qualities, and accompanied our host, Senor
Bonifacio, in a ride to his plantation. Here we saw the coffee
trees in full bearing, planted in lines and squares, so as to
make the distance about nine feet between each tree, and
extending over a very large area of land. The appearance
of this field gives evidence of much careful attention, and
though the coffee trees continue to grow in the same place
from fifteen to twenty years, it is found to be important to
their production that the land should be kept in good
order; and, if not cultivated in other things, it is annually
cleaned around the trees, and very often a compost, formed
by the hull of the coffee with other articles, is put upon the
ground to enrich it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were some young trees recently planted which had
not borne any coffee, and a crop is not expected until the
fourth year after setting out the plants, unless the plants
should be over a year old, and then a partial yield will be
obtained at the end of the third year from transplanting.</p>

<p class='c007'>A nursery of the coffee plants was shown to us, and
presented much the appearance of a young plumb thicket,
when the sprouts had reached the height of from eighteen
inches to two feet. This coffee nursery had been planted
among some advanced stalks of the mandioca, which served
to shade them when young and tender; and they had been
gradually thinned out to give the plants more air and sun
as their growth advanced. There was a large piece of
ground in readiness to receive these plants so soon as there
might be sufficient rain to transplant them.</p>

<p class='c007'>This land had the timber felled and dried, when fire was
applied and burnt over the whole, destroying all the leaves
and small limbs, and yet leaving the larger limbs and
trunks upon the ground. In the midst of this network, it
was expected to set out the coffee trees, and between them
to plant corn and beans, with the expectation of getting a
full crop of the latter articles. Of course no ploughing is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>practicable, and all the work is done with the hoe, as is the
case with nearly all the culture of this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The corn which had been planted here had usually five
or six stalks in the hill, and I observed from the number of
old stalks from last year, standing in some places together,
that it is the custom to let this number remain in one place.
Although the yield is reported to be good with this mode
of culture, it is very evident that fewer grains in a hill and
the use of the plough would enhance the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Bonifacio showed me a specimen of a large many-toothed
plough, which was of French manufacture, and
fitted alone for ground that was smooth and without roots.
He has also a specimen of the large American plough, which
is better adapted to ordinary use. But he has done little
more than experiment with these implements, and the
difficulties attending the use of the complicated French
ploughing machine will be a barrier to its successful
employment; while the want of knowledge and of training
on the part of negroes and animals will doubtless prevent
him from turning the other to practical account. The farmer
of the United States is needed here to learn the fazendeiros
of Brazil the proper use of the plough, and should
any considerable number remove to this country, they will
effect quite a revolution in agriculture in a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trunks of many of the immense trees which had constituted
the original forest were lying upon a piece of fresh
land, and the Pon D’Alho and Figare Branco were pointed
out to me as the indications of good soil, when found thus
in close proximity. The former has the smell of garlic,
even in the dry state, and when burned, it yields a large
proportion of potash from the ashes. It is said likewise to
have the property of attracting the magnetic needle to such
an extent as to interfere with the accuracy of the compass
in surveying lands where it is to be encountered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Jangada is a small tree which springs up on land of
good quality which has been under cultivation, but is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>thrown out to rest and recuperate. The second forest
growth upon this kind of soil is called in the Portuguese
language “Capoera;” and the land varies in quality, as it
has been more or less exhausted by the first cultivation.
Hence the importance of noting those growths upon it,
which indicate that it continues to be productive.</p>

<p class='c007'>My object in examining these improved plantations in
the outset is to get information as to the different qualities
of soil and their productions; and at the same time to get
the views and the experience of disinterested parties, as to
all matters that may assist me in making a judicious selection
of territory for my friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the saw-mill of Senor Bonifacio, near his residence,
was seen the wood of the Cabriuve, which is a very hard,
brown material, used in constructing machinery, or for
building purposes. The Tariba is a yellow and very
durable substance, used for posts, which are set in the
earth. The Sucupina is very bitter to the taste, and is
also of a yellow hue. It is likewise very durable when
partially embedded in the ground. The Goncalo Aldes is
of a most beautifully-variegated, dark brown and yellow
color. It is very hard and finely grained, so as to admit
of the highest polish; and is employed for the frames of
pictures or other decorative work by cabinet makers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The different qualities of wood enumerated in the last
paragraph have been used in connection with the magnificent
dwelling of our host, which has just been completed
in the most elaborate style.</p>

<p class='c007'>A team of fourteen oxen was seen here, attached to a
strong high-wheeled cart, beneath which a huge log was
suspended at one end and dragged upon the other end in
the manner adopted in the States. These carts have the
wheels fixed firmly upon the ends of the axles, so that all
revolve together, and this plan is generally observed in
all the vehicles for the use of oxen even when there are
four wheels. The junction of the axle with the other portions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of the wagon or cart is not usually lubricated so as
to prevent the creaking noise from friction in the revolution
of the wheels, and consequently progressing is attended
with a sound that may be heard at the distance usually of
half a mile, or even farther, in some instances. This harsh
and shrill sound is thought to have a very important effect
upon the performance of the oxen that have become accustomed
to it, and unless it is heard they manifest an unwillingness
to go forward with the load. Hence it is that
these carts are rarely greased, and the drivers consider
the music as a necessary accompaniment to their carts.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one time the municipal authorities of the city of São
Paulo decreed that those carts which entered the capital
should be so lubricated as to obviate this noise, declaring
that it was a nuisance to the city. But the consequence
was that the carts did not come in to bring the wood for
fuel or to perform any other service, the owners insisting
that the oxen would not work without this old familiar
sound, and the edict was repealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately in front of the residence, and not more than
one hundred yards distant, is the machinery of the saw-mill,
grist-mill, and coffee-mill, all moved by water-power,
brought by a race from a dam some four or five hundred
yards off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this stream there are seven distinct falls, and this
has fixed the name of the place, and of its proprietor, as
“Settequéda,” the Portuguese word for seven falls. This
gentleman is known far and near by this name, and it is
the ordinary title given him by his friends in social intercourse.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the apparatus here embodies all the most recent improvements
for treating the coffee, it will be described with
some minuteness. It is what is styled a “despolpidor,” and
receives the coffee directly from the tree, without any preliminary
process of drying, and even while the berries are yet
red, previous to their becoming black. This saves much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>trouble which attends other processes, and enables the
coffee-grower to gather his crops earlier than when it is
required to dry upon the tree, or to be dried after gathering,
prior to cleaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coffee brought directly from the trees is placed first
in a receptacle built with brick and cement, containing
water; which not only washes the berries, but floats them
forward with a current that runs from this tank by a small
trough to another receiver, which constitutes the despolpidor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this there is a revolving cylinder of brass or copper,
which has the surface roughened like a blacksmith’s rasp;
and as the coffee passes into the cavity where this revolves,
it comes in contact with this rough exterior surface, and
the outside hull of the berry is detached, and the investing
membrane of each separate grain is more or less torn, but
not entirely separated. This being accomplished, the hulls
drop out at a waste-way, and the grains are carried below
with the water into a large reservoir. Here there are arms
or sweeps of wood revolving upon a central shaft, and
constantly stirring and agitating the coffee in the water, as
it passes with the current to the most dependent portion.
There it is subjected to a percolating process of washing
by the passage of the water through it, and out below
through a perforated plate. From this it is dipped up by
a system of cups or buckets, such as is used for elevating
flour in our bolting apparatus, and is deposited in a large
cemented reservoir, from which any remaining water is
drained off through perforations in the bottom. The coffee
is now taken out to be subjected to the drying process for
the first and only time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The yard for drying the coffee, called “tereiro,” is a
neatly paved, level space, with a number of divisions for
receiving the coffee in the different stages of drying. This
being laid with glazed tile, and entirely free from dust or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>other impurity, that can affect the clean grains of coffee,
the drying is accomplished in the most satisfactory manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a portion of the investment of each grain remains
attached to it after it is completely dry, the process of
fanning has still to be resorted to; and in this unique
establishment two fans are connected, so as to receive the
coffee one from the other; and the last so arranged with a
sieve of graduated openings, that the large, fine grains of
coffee are separated from the smaller and imperfect grains.
All being now entirely clean and assorted, it is ready for
sacking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The house in which this entire machinery is arranged is
not exceeding twenty-five feet square; and though there
are three different elevations, in which different stages of
the work are conducted, yet but one floor is required in
the building. This compact and nicely-adjusted apparatus
does great credit to the energy and enterprise of the proprietor;
and though he has received many suggestions from
other establishments, there is, perhaps, no single coffee-mill
in Brazil that combines so much efficiency and economy of
labor in treating this great staple. I would therefore urge
those who may be entering upon this business to make a
visit to Settequéda, even should it be two hundred miles
distant, so as to get the details of this establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coffee treated in this way has a value in the market
of from five to ten per cent. above that cleaned by the
ordinary process; and when a fine article is desired for
family use, it will command in Brazil a higher price than
any of the coffee shipped to the United States ever brings
in that market. I am informed here, that none of the
finest specimens of coffee are shipped from Brazil to the
United States, as the merchants will not pay the prices
at which they sell in Rio de Janeiro. But these fine
lots of coffee find a market in England, and consequently
all the best coffee takes that channel of trade. We are
accustomed, in the United States, to think that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>mere talk as to the superiority of the living in England;
yet, undoubtedly, their progress in manufactures and arts
is not without a proportionate advancement in what pertains
to comfort in their households, and to gratification of
taste at their tables.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>We took our leave of Settequéda this morning, and the
gentlemanly proprietor rode with us to an adjoining fazenda
belonging to his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we had an exemplification of another process for hulling
the coffee, and next in importance to that we have described
as being effected by the despolpidor. It consists
in the use of the mortar and pestle, after the manner
adopted in the rice mills of South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of mortars being excavated from a solid trunk
of wood, and thus placed side by side in a row, constitutes
the first element. Next, pestles for each mortar are arranged,
with upright pieces of timber, having an aperture
of about two and a half feet long, and two inches in width;
and these are set in a frame so as to preserve a perpendicular
position. The final appliance is a shaft, with arms
extending so as to catch in these apertures at each revolution,
and raising the pestle a certain distance, the arm slips
again from the aperture, and the pestle falls into the mortar,
thus by its weight pounding the coffee. These arms
are so arranged that a portion of the pestles are elevated
at each arc of the circle of revolution; so the work is continuous,
under the operation of the water-power by which
the machinery is put in motion. By this process the hull
is very effectually broken and detached from the grain, but
then the use of a ventilator is requisite to separate the
grains and larger portions of the hull, and the sieve is
required with the blowing of the operation, while the coffee
is thrown up in the air time after time, to clean out all
foreign matter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>In coming out from the examination of the working of
the coffee we were regaled with some very fine oranges,
which were the more prized because almost out of season
in this region. There were also some fine specimens of the
Mamão, a fruit which has its name from the supposed resemblance
to the female breast. It grows upon the tree in
clusters near the trunk, or, in a different species, upon long
pendulous branches extending out some distance from the
body of the tree. It is nearly as large as a small cantelope,
and resembles in color and taste the mushmelon.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we were leaving this place Dom Vaz, of Campinas,
was met at the gate, and introduced to us by Senor Bonifacio.
He was coming, as we supposed, upon a professional
visit, and was mounted upon a very fine mule, which is the
most usual and most efficient means of transportation in
this country. I was impressed with his intelligent and
sprightly appearance, with a characteristic energy and
activity in his manner, though perhaps fifty years of age.
I learned he formerly resided in Rio de Janeiro, but not
having good health there he removed to the city of Campinas,
and has, in a few years, secured a large and profitable
business in his profession as a physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our way back to our quarters we overtook Senor
Joaquim Egydio de Sonsa Aranha, to whom a letter was
delivered from Senor Dom Bernardo Gaveão. It was read,
and then he extended his hand, expressing his satisfaction
at making my acquaintance. His physiognomy is the
most demure, and his manner the least demonstrative, of
any gentleman that I have yet seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was the last President of the House of Deputies of
the Provincial Assembly, and there may be a great deal in
this grave exterior, proving that deep water runs smooth.
Upon reaching his house, he offered us whatever we might
choose from his enumerated assortment of drinks. Mr.
Bennaton indicated ale, and this, with porter, was produced
upon a waiter by a negro. I was now particularly struck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>with an illustration of the sentiment, that “Actions speak
louder than words,” on the part of our host; who, instead
of ordering a cork-screw, made a twisting motion of the
hand, and a look in the direction from which he expected it
to be brought. This was understood, and the article brought
accordingly to open the bottles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some other gentlemen of a more lively cast rode up soon
after our arrival, and, dismounting, left their mules, with the
bridles thrown down upon the ground. This seems to be a
signal for the animal to stand until some one comes to take
charge of it, and all well-trained mules seem to understand
this; but occasionally, as in this party, one walks off to
look after what he may be able to gather from the yard or
the crib.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the entrance of this party there was no formal introduction
to us, and yet bows were exchanged, and one of
them approached and shook hands with me. I should have
construed the previous demeanor of Senor Egydio, in connection
with his failure to present me to his friends, as indicative
of a want of proper respect; but his manner with
them was much the same as previously, and I am informed
by Mr. Bennaton that introductions under such circumstances
are not customary in this country. The persons
meeting in this way are expected to find out each other as
best they may; and, with this view, it is usual to set about
a system of interrogation as to the name, business, distinction,
&#38;c., of one another. I am not favorably impressed
with this style of doing business, and must think that a due
regard for the courtesies of life require that introductions
should be given when strangers meet in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>We made but a brief visit, and left without any special
demonstration of interest in our movements by this demure
provincial deputy. That he intended to be polite, I have
no reason to doubt; but if I had to encounter such a demeanor
from all persons to whom letters are borne, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>most natural inference would be, that my mission was not
entirely acceptable.</p>

<p class='c007'>After returning to Tapera, where our baggage had been
left, we proceeded to pack up our trunks, so as to let the
camarada start this afternoon with the pack-mules, and thus
keep in advance of us.</p>

<p class='c007'>In looking around the yard here, I observed a large number
of hogs, and, for the most part, in good order, but most
of them being molested with the small bicho that penetrates
the skin wherever there is least hair. This little
insect is black, like a flea, but enters the skin like a chigre,
and is very prone to get into the feet of persons who are
even for a few minutes without shoes, and make a sore
place if not extracted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon, we took a walk into the coffee field, and
though the most of the crop had been gathered, there were
a number of trees having their full supply of berries.
Upon counting some of the best-filled limbs, I found a single
straight twig to contain about seventy-five berries or
one hundred and fifty grains, and three pounds to the tree
is an average yield.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Our pack-mules having gone on yesterday afternoon, we
rode out this morning from the fazenda of Senor Queiroz,
known as Tapera, and proceeded to Campinas, where we
expected to call upon Dr. Reinhardt; but he was absent on
a visit to Sorocaba. This gentleman came originally from
the United States, with others, under a commission to make
a botanical exploration of the country, and, after closing his
engagement with the government, he concluded to remain
in the country, and is very much esteemed by all who know
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This city, like other interior towns, has but little to attract
the favorable notice of one who has been accustomed
to the display of architectural taste in the cities of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>United States. Yet there are a number of neatly-constructed
houses, and those more recently built manifest an
improvement in style which seems to augur better for the
future.</p>

<p class='c007'>The elaborate work of carving which has been executed
in the recently erected Catholic church exceeds any specimen
of native art which has been seen in Brazil. The most
extensive decorations of the interior of the building, and
the most artistic figures upon eight different altars on either
side of the long and lofty hall, prepare us for the grand and
rich ornaments which encircle the great altar at the end of
the church. The great length of the building, and the lofty
elevation of the unsupported arch overhead, are, of themselves,
remarkable features of this region, and would commend
this structure to our attention, if there was nothing
to attract within.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the specimens of exquisite carving in native wood of
the country present the most elegant and delicate workmanship
that the world can produce. It seems as if the
genius of some other land had been transformed to this
city to give a fancy sketch which might seem to elevate the
taste of the people. All the work is not yet completed,
and there were several artisans engaged in carving out
figures from the rough pieces of wood. But there seems
to be no general movement towards finishing the work, and
the general aspect of the exterior of the building is that of
a ruin, rather than the progressive improvement of a growing
structure.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The common people in all these interior towns look as if
they had little to do, and less to think about, and it evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>afforded considerable curiosity to men and women
as we passed through the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the better class of women confine themselves
closely to their houses, or, if seen upon the street, have
their heads covered with the hood of a cloak which envelops
their persons. But a more numerous class of females err
on the other extreme; and with bare heads and bare arms,
their natural developments are open to all observers.
There is a style adopted very generally by this class, of
having only the chemise on the body, and a skirt about the
waist, thus bringing parts into view which modesty prompts
most females to conceal with great care.</p>

<p class='c007'>This free and easy apparel is also adopted by the female
servants that are seen about the inns or hospedarias for the
accommodation of travellers; and while it may do for a
negro woman employed at washing or other duties, I am
surprised that the white women, who have any self-respect,
should appear in public, thus loosely attired about their
breasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not uncommon on the route we came through the
country, to see the Portuguese and negroes accompanying
the troops of pack-mules without a shirt. Though they are
provided with this garment, it is thrown across the mule
upon which the man is mounted, or tied around his waist,
and thus the sun comes in direct contact with the skin.
This kind of exposure cannot be comfortable, and it cannot
be necessary for the free use of the arms when no labor is
performed, yet they seem to have a partiality for stripping
to the buff in this way. Common decency in the United
States would forbid this sort of public denuding of the
person, but here it is a part of the programme of this kind
of life, and is not noticed by those accustomed to the
habits of the country, so far as respects this class of people.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the contrary of the view here given, it will be found
that the Brazilian gentleman is quite as circumspect in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>regard to his person as respects exposure and cleanliness
as the most fastidious taste would exact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands lying along the road after leaving the immediate
vicinity of Campinas were not found under such fine
cultivation, and we saw again signs of the copina, which
throws up its mounds of earth in almost every abandoned
field of this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped about noon at one of the roadside inns and
got our horses fed, while we waited leisurely for dinner to
be prepared for us. Resting until 4 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, the voyage
was resumed, and riding twelve miles, we stopped for
the night at the hospedaria of Ponte Atibaia. Here we had
condiments with our supper and fared well in all respects.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>All hands were around this morning at half-past four
o’clock, to prepare for the road, and coffee was ordered
while we dressed. Each of the party seemed to have put
on his best outfit in view of the day, and the fact that
Ybicaba was our destination. Even our camarada had put
on a neat white shirt and boots, whereas he had heretofore
been barefooted, as is the custom with this class of men on
most occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It presents quite an odd spectacle to see one of these
fellows mounted upon a mule with bare feet, and a huge
pair of spurs strapped about his ankles. His stirrups are
purposely small, so as to receive but two or three toes, and
when they have rode a great deal, quite a space is formed
between the toes, by the constant pressure of the stirrup.
My inference in regard to thus having the stirrups so small
is, to prevent the possibility of the entire foot being caught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in the stirrups in case a man is thrown from his mule, as it
certainly cannot be for comfort or convenience, either in
mounting or riding with the bare feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro servants here much more frequently wear
shoes than the Portuguese camaradas or troupeiros, and
the boy Joaquim who accompanies Mr. Bennaton is well-dressed,
and keeps himself neat and clean at all times. He
is out this morning with white pants and his hair combed
and braided in the most approved darkey style. He is
beginning to understand my little phrases of the Portuguese
language, and seems disposed to render me any
assistance or service required.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we set out this morning, shortly after five o’clock,
it was not yet clear daylight, and the atmosphere was quite
cool, rendering our overcoats indispensable for comfort.
Indeed they have been used every morning until 9 o’clock,
but after that hour it becomes warm, and from 12 o’clock
until 3 o’clock in the afternoon the sun is oppressively hot.
The heat here, however, is not greater than is experienced
in the United States during the summer months, and the
temperature of this climate at night is invariably more
pleasant than in the Southern States.</p>

<p class='c007'>All well know that the winter in the United States
is during those months which constitute the summer of
Brazil; and vice versa, so that, now, while it is becoming
colder north of the equator, the heat is increasing in this
southern latitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far, less inconvenience has been experienced from
the heat than was anticipated, and but for the protracted
drought, which has parched the earth, and retarded vegetation
of every kind in this section, the atmosphere would
now be more agreeable during the middle of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no part of my plan to eulogize the climate, or any
other feature of this country, except as the facts may warrant
a favorable estimate. Having an opportunity to judge of
the nature of the climate in the latter part of winter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>spring, with the forthcoming summer, I may determine
with some certainty what will be its effects upon people
from our latitude, by my personal experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The range of the thermometer as yet has not exceeded
85° Fahrenheit; and the sensible influence of the sun is
not greater than I have experienced at a corresponding
season in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the region of country through which we passed
to-day consisted of plateau land rather sparsely timbered
with large trees, and some of it resembled the low lands a
short distance from the banks of our rivers. This was overgrown
with shrubbery and bamboo cane, and having a growth
of small trees interspersed with large timber. The general
aspect of the surface was that of an undulating plain, but
occasionally we encountered a ravine of considerable depth,
making the descent and ascent rather difficult for our animals,
and almost impracticable for carts or wagons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The supply of water was more deficient upon our route
to-day than upon any part of the road travelled heretofore;
and however desirable land might be here, the difficulty of
procuring an adequate supply of water, either for drinking
or for machinery, would be a serious objection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twelve miles from our starting point we entered the town
of Lemeire, which has sprung up within a few years to a
respectable size. Some of the houses presented a very good
appearance, but the usually dull aspect of these mud-built
houses gives a monotony to all these interior towns which
may excuse any detailed notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since leaving the mountain range, this side of Jundiahi,
the nature of the soil and the general configuration of the
surface has undergone a gradual change, with a better adaptation
to agricultural purposes. The dark reddish or brown
color of the earth, which predominates in this region, is
considered to be of volcanic origin in some former period of
the world, and called “terra rocha.” It is found to be
especially well adapted to the culture of coffee, and likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>well adapted to the growth of corn and beans, while the experiment
made thus far with the cotton plant promises also
an abundant yield. There is, however, a somewhat sandy
level soil in parts, interspersed with these dark red lands,
which present to my view very favorable indications for the
culture of cotton, and the experience of planters will soon
develop whether the former or the latter can be cultivated
to best advantage in this crop.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> we arrived at the magnificent fazenda
of Commendador José Vergueiro, known as Ybicaba. He
gave me a hearty welcome in the English language, and
told me any thing and every thing in his house was to be
used as my own while it might suit me to remain with him.
In extenuation of his imperfect use of the English tongue,
he said that he had told Mr. Bennaton in Portuguese, of his
desire to accommodate me, and he wished me to make
known through him any thing I might want.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was very much pleased to find here, also, Senor Henry
Whitaker, who speaks English well, and my sojourn here is
likely to be relieved of much of the embarrassment of intercourse
with others. The lady of Commendador Vergueiro
does not speak English, but seems very kindly disposed,
and very dignified in her manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached here just in time to join the family at breakfast,
and after a ride of eighteen miles I enjoyed the tender
and fat beefsteak, with nice wheat bread and coffee, in
connection with the other supplies of the table. There was
such a variety of articles for breakfast, and every thing in
such excellent order, that it could not have been much improved
by notice of our coming. After concluding breakfast,
Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Bennaton and myself, indulged a
walk round the garden, where quite a variety of fruit trees
were seen growing in the greatest perfection. The orange,
the pine apple, and also the peach, were among the number.
A specimen of the genuine tea-plant was also seen here, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>there was only a few plants, and no attempt to cultivate it
for use of the family or for market.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between 3 and 4 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> dinner was announced,
and we had a most sumptuous feast of good things. The
absence of fowl of any kind was again noticed, and turkeys,
ducks and chickens are evidently not so much prized here
as with us. Big hominy, of the whitest and nicest form, is
used here with boiled milk as a dessert; and though very
different from our mode of using the article, it is very good
in this way. I told Mr. Bennaton that it would be more
relished if fried, or eaten with gravy, as a part of the substantials
of the meal. But he said it would surprise the
people in this country very much to see the canjeen, as it
is here called, eaten in that mode; and I therefore conform
to the custom of the land, and take it as dessert with milk
or syrup.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon we walked out to the colony of Germans,
French and Portuguese, located upon this place. I counted
one hundred and sixty-four tenements for families, and
learned that there were thirty-six others occupied, making
two hundred families. They are here engaged to gather the
coffee from the fields, at fixed rates for each bushel, and have
a house with a small parcel of land, upon which to grow a
little corn or other articles for themselves. They live in the
most saving manner, with a view to accumulate enough to
buy a place and live upon it, and the interior of their
houses seemed to have a scanty outfit.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving my room this morning I asked the servant
for water to take a general bath, saying, “Fraga me agua,
para lavor,” to which his reply was an interrogation,
“Quente ou frio?” (warm or cold,) and I said, “Quero frio,”
(I wish cold.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus my acquisitions in the language are beginning to
avail me, and I trust in a short time to be able to make
known all my ordinary wants.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>We set out before breakfast to make a survey of the extensive
establishment for treating the coffee, which is run
by steam-power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first step is to remove the outer hull of the berries,
and for this purpose he employs four dispolpadores, such as
described at Settequéda, each being capable of hulling five
hundred bushels of the crude berries in a day, making two
thousand in a day when all are fully employed. Not having
a supply of water sufficient to move the machinery, or
to float the coffee into the apparatus, it has to be washed
before going into the dispolpadores if it should be dirty, and
it may then be put in while wet. After the hull is removed,
the coffee grains having still their separate investment, are
dried in the ample tile-covered yard that is adjoining the
building. The cleaning process is conducted by two large
fans, and if any of the smaller grains slip through the sieve
of the fan without being entirely cleaned, they are submitted
to hand sieves. Thus, all the coffee is prepared for sacking.
The specimens seen in the building were entirely free from
dust or any foreign matter, and the proprietor states will
command from two to five cents per pound more than the
rolled or pounded coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The store-room contains an immense amount of uncleaned
coffee, and the crop made on this place this year is reckoned
at fifty thousand arrobas, or sixteen hundred thousand
pounds of clean coffee. This is below the annual average
crop, and Senor Vergueiro thinks the blooming trees indicate
a larger yield for the next crop.</p>

<p class='c007'>This coffee milling establishment is upon a much larger
scale than that of Settequéda, but there are a number of
conveniences and improvements in the latter, which the
want of water does not admit here.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a saw-mill adjoining the coffee-mill, which is
run by a separate engine of four horse-power, and performs
very satisfactorily with a perpendicular saw.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>In addition to these there is a cotton-gin, and packing
apparatus under the same roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>An American cotton-gin of seventy saws is run by the
same engine, of eight horse-power, which works the coffee
machinery. The compress or packing apparatus is a pattern
which has been in use for some years in the United
States, but is made upon a small scale to pack bales of
ninety-six pounds for transportation upon pack-mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gin and compress were brought from Santos upon
wagons drawn by oxen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ordinary hemp bagging is used here for covering the
cotton, and the sepo vine, which grows in this country
abundantly, makes an admirable substitute for roping. It
is very unyielding, and being smooth, with a facility for
knotting, it fulfils all the indications completely and economically.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hull of the coffee, and the cotton seed, with the refuse
from the saw-mill, have constituted the fuel for the steam-engine,
thus wasting the cotton seed that might be made
very profitable, either by converting them into oil, or for
manure. Upon bringing these matters to the attention of
Senor Vergueiro, he expressed his intention to cease this
destructive policy; and until he may be able to procure an
apparatus for the manufacture of the cotton seed oil, he
proposes to accumulate his seed, when it will be convenient
to pour water upon them, if it should not rain sufficient to
wet them, and thus rot them for manure.</p>

<p class='c007'>A blacksmith shop and a woodshop are in very successful
operation, making his own wagons, and machinery for all
the purposes of his extensive establishment; and all of
good quality.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large and well-arranged brickyard is brought into
requisition for the manufacture of brick, tiles, and earthen
pipes, that are demanded about the place; and his fazenda
being within itself a village, the consumption of these
articles is very considerable throughout the year.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The negro quarters are adjoining the residence of the
family, and enclose a large court, in the centre of which is
a belfry, and a lock-up for such as become unruly. There
is a hospital department, with an office, where medicine is
dispensed by the physician when his visits are required.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stables are large and well-arranged for feeding, and
the stalls are substantially floored with sawed plank, while
there is an upper story for hay.</p>

<p class='c007'>A spacious and neat fowl-house has recently been constructed,
connected with an open grass lot, having a supply
of water for the poultry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old coffee-mill and saw-mill, moved by water-power,
are still preserved in good running order on the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner to-day we were supplied with fine saddle
horses, and accompanied Senor Vergueiro over his wide
domain of a million coffee trees and fine cotton lands. We
rode rapidly over miles of winding roads through the fields
of coffee, stopping here and there to examine some feature
of special interest, either in the mode of management or
the development of the trees. Some had been growing
there for twenty-six years that still presented a vigorous
appearance and afforded a good yield of coffee this season.
Others that were thirty-four years old have been cut off
eighteen inches above the ground, two years since, and
have again put forth branches, which present all the aspects
of thriving trees. They have borne a crop of coffee this
season, and the blooms afford a fine prospect for another
year. This is a very interesting feature in the management
of the old trunks of the coffee, as the advantages of a new
growth are secured in one-half the time it could be attained
from a new plant. Even should the root require to be
dug around and manured, it would be far preferable to the
uncertainty connected with the growth of a new plant; and
in lands of good quality it certainly presents great advantages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stumps of the cotton stalk were also seen during our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>ride, which had recently been cut off for the purpose of
securing the growth of another crop. There is a perennial
growth of the cotton plant in this latitude, from the absence
of frost; and by simply cutting away the limbs in the early
spring another development ensues, which produces a larger
yield than the first crop; and it is supposed that it may be
cut off again at the end of the second year, and produce for
the third time a full crop of cotton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the risks attending the sprouting and the early
growth of the plant are avoided here; and as the evidence
is conclusive that the yield of the second year is superior
to that of the first, the advantages for the culture of cotton
in this country gives it a preference to the southern part of
the United States. The additional element of slave labor
here is likely to afford results that cannot be secured by
hired labor in the Southern States; and so soon as the
negroes have become acquainted with the proper mode of
working the cotton, we may anticipate yields of this staple
exceeding any that have ever been realized in the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The production of cotton here already is stated to reach
two thousand pounds of seed cotton to the acre; and if this
is a uniform yield of good land with good culture it is a
decided success. There is not so much labor bestowed upon
the plant here as in the Southern States, and the hoe is the
only implement employed in the culture of this, or any thing
else. It will appear marvellous to our heroic cotton planters
that no preparatory ploughing is done, and that not even a
hoe is used in planting the seed. The process, as I observed
it here, consists in a negro scratching a place in the
ground with his hand, and making three or four holes with
the end of a stick, into which seeds of cotton are dropped
and covered with the hand. This is done at distances of two
and a half feet, and sticks of wood or pieces of cane are stuck
into the ground to mark the place, and by this means to
preserve right lines for the rows. Note this, ye planters of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>cotton in the Southern States, and think how painstaking
you are to develop the growth of cotton in its several
stages; yet here, in Brazil, it grows and matures well without
culture of any kind. If cotton can be relied upon here
to yield an average crop without labor, what may be expected
from proper preparation of the soil for receiving the
seed, and thorough working of the ground during the early
growth of the plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finding that the root of the cotton remained in the ground
during the winter without injury, Senor Vergueiro supposed
an advantage might be gained by planting the cotton
seed during the winter, so that it might sprout up and commence
growing in the earliest portion of the spring. He
planted accordingly a considerable piece of ground in the
month of May, which is in this latitude very nearly as November
in the State of Louisiana. The prospect is quite
unfavorable from present appearance of the plants, and he
expects to replant the land, with the exception of a small
space, to test fully the experiment. Had he known how
much depends upon the disappearance of all frost, and the
warming of the earth under the genial suns of the spring,
as a preliminary to cotton planting, in the land where experience
is the guide to success, this experiment would not
have been necessary to convince him that nothing could be
gained by the planting of the seed in the cold season,
though there might be no frost to kill the plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Vergueiro deserves great credit, however, for the
boldness and energy with which he has urged forward his
improvements, and others are now profiting by his enterprise
in the domain of agriculture and the arts.</p>

<p class='c007'>He produces all the corn requisite to raise hogs for his
consumption, and also for a large number of horses and
mules, keeping a pack of the latter to assist in transporting
his coffee to market. He cures a considerable amount of
hay for the use of his animals in winter, when the grass
does not grow so abundantly; and I have heard of no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>person in the country who gives any attention to haymaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we find this fazendeiro combines all the various
interests that conduce to the comfort of his family and the
welfare of the large number of colonists and slaves who are
dependent upon him for supplies. His extensive fazenda
is emphatically a self-sustaining establishment, and he lives
within himself to a very large extent. He grows his own
beef and mutton, as well as his hogs, and his table is always
supplied with the best that is found anywhere in the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, there are many things which must come from
other parts, and he avails himself of all the importations
that may render a household comfortable, or a table desirable.
Though hams are not cured here, the finest was found
upon his table; and though flour comes from abroad, the
choice varieties of flour bread, as well as other kinds, showed
the domestic management of the estimable senhora most
satisfactorily.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We took our leave this morning of our kind friends at
Ybicaba, and with a guide furnished by Senor José Vergueiro,
we set out for the fazenda of Senor Rafael Paes de
Barros, son of the Baron of Rerecicoba.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our route lay through a region having a very large
growth of timber, and we saw trees of eight feet in diameter,
which gives twenty-four feet around the base of the trunk.
The soil in this vicinity is of a dark red or purple color, and
of a loose loamy consistence. It is the richest land of this
country, and produces to great advantage all the crops
usually planted here; yet some planters think this rich
purple soil, that is known here as “terra rocha,” is not so
well adapted to the culture of cotton as the land which has
an admixture of sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached São Antonio, the residence of Senor Barros,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>about 12 o’clock, and he met us in the front yard with an
open expression of hospitality, which made me feel that his
words of welcome were not a mere empty sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>After showing us his cotton house, where he had a large
quantity of cotton in the seed, he took us to his recently-constructed
gin-house, where the machinery is moved by
water-power. He has a thirty-saw gin of American manufacture,
and a small screw of his own make, which will meet
his present wants; but so soon as his large force is employed
in growing cotton, the appliances for preparing it
for market must be greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>His experiment in the culture of cotton has been entirely
satisfactory, and he considers the crop of great importance
with the present high price in Rio.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article grown here is of better quality than most of
the cotton grown in the Southern States, and the fibre is
not only longer and finer, but it is evidently stronger than
our cotton. Some small specimens of the sea island cotton
have been seen, which grew in this region of country, and
they presented a beautiful silky-looking fibre; yet the size
of the bolls, and the general yield of the stalks, does not
afford encouragement to grow it rather than the other
qualities of cotton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this fazenda there are four hundred thousand
coffee trees, of which two hundred and eighty thousand are
bearing fruit, and the others are young trees recently
planted out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being invited to remain for dinner, we enjoyed a most
abundant supply of the substantials, as well as the delicacies
of the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senhora manifested her respect by meeting us with a bow
before going to her seat at the table, and though she made
but few remarks during the dinner, this was simply in accordance
with the recognized rôle of females in society here.
A lady in Brazil is kept secluded to a great extent, and is
rarely seen in a parlor with gentlemen, except they may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>intimate friends of the family. When seen at the table, she
is usually seated by her husband, or if he is at the end of
the table her position is adjacent to the corner upon his
right or left hand, and guests are seated on the opposite
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of young ladies the restrictions are still
greater, and with the existing regime, I don’t understand
how gentlemen become sufficiently intimate with young
ladies to form a basis of marriage. Yet matrimonial alliances
are here formed very early, and perhaps in part influenced
by the desire of the parent to transfer the guardianship
of his daughter to other hands, so that he may be relieved
of the sense of responsibility. I am told that it is not uncommon
for girls to be married as early as they reach the
age of thirteen or fourteen years. The physical development
of females in this climate is much in advance of those
in colder latitudes, and they become mothers in Brazil before
females in the United States are considered marriageable.
Not only is their vigor of frame thus impaired, but the cultivation
of their minds is in like manner arrested by the
cares which must necessarily devolve upon them, and really
it seems that the evil of secluding females from the freedom
of society brings with it a host of other evils. If the cause
be corrected, the effects will be remedied as a natural consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Barras very kindly proposed to furnish me letters
to parties who might aid me in the prosecution of my
objects, and with the assurance of his cordial good wishes
we proceeded on our line of travel in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a pleasant ride of three miles across the country,
in which the Rio Claro was crossed, we reached the town
known by the name of São João de Rio Claro. It is constructed
chiefly with one-story houses, after the style of
other interior towns through which we passed, yet there is
more of neatness in their appearance, and in the order of
the streets, than has been noted elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>We called, with a letter of introduction, upon Tenente
Coronel Senor José Estaninlaus D’Oliveiro, the commandant
of the national guard for this district.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has recently proposed to give one hundred dollars to
every citizen of his district who would volunteer for the
active service of the war.</p>

<p class='c007'>When my mission was explained to him, he signified his
readiness to aid me, and said his house was open for me or
any of my friends whenever it might suit us to stop with
him. He gave us an invitation to spend the night at his
house, but my object being to see as much of the country
as possible, I thanked him for his kind offer, and departed
with his best wishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In proceeding from Rio Claro we encountered the first
open plains I had seen, and with a poor sandy soil; there
was scarcely grass sufficient to sustain the cattle that were
here and there scattered over these campo lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>For several miles the monotony was only broken by a
few huge ant-hills, that seemed to be the result of some
considerable excavation of the earth, and the inquiry was
naturally suggested whether the people had been digging
for gold or making a well for water.</p>

<p class='c007'>This striking contrast of barren plains, in close proximity
to the richest forest lands, is a very remarkable characteristic
of this section.</p>

<p class='c007'>After passing a large area of this waste land, we reached
another fazenda of Senor José Vergueiro, called Angelica,
where he awaited our arrival, and repeated the kindly reception
which had been extended to us at Ybicaba. This
place is ten miles from Rio Claro, and consists of twenty-six
thousand acres of land. Much of this large domain is
campo land, of little value; and yet there is an immense
body of very valuable land, a part being under cultivation
in coffee, sugar-cane, cotton, corn, rice, beans, &#38;c., while
there is yet a large portion of original forest that is favorably
located and of good quality.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The buildings on this place are of huge proportions, and
the machinery adapted to all the practical operations of the
various departments of industry. Water-power is used for
a saw-mill, a grist-mill and a coffee-mill, while oxen are
employed in running a wooden mill for the sugar-cane.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facilities here for conducting the various kinds of
business are not equal to those at Ybicaba, yet the basis
is here for indefinite additions and improvements in the
appliances, and the energy of the proprietor is likely to
render all its resources available for efficient operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>This place was formerly the family residence of the father
and mother of Senor Vergueiro, and the name, Angelica, is
that of his mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>His father was a man of considerable note, and was for a
time regent of the empire during the minority of the present
Emperor. He has been dead several years, and this property
is held jointly by the heirs, but under the control of
the gentleman above-named, who expects to make it the
counterpart of Ybicaba.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this place there is a mill-race, four miles long, but
even then the water reaches only midway the immense wheel,
making it a breast-wheel, however, of immense power, by
the large column of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the negroes came into the house to salute their master,
with the customary placing of hands together, and saying
“Santa Christ,”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> which is an abbreviation for “Louvado
seja nosso <a id='t112'></a>senhor Jesus Christ,” that is said by almost every
negro in meeting a white person.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Having enjoyed a comfortable bed for the night, we had
a cup of coffee upon rising this morning, and afterwards
joined Senor Vergueiro in making an examination of a very
substantial and neat residence of sandstone, which has
been recently erected on this place. The sandstone is procured
from a quarry located upon the lands of the fazenda,
and when dressed makes a very excellent wall. The general
plan of the house was made by Senor Vergueiro, but the
services of an engineer named Shelb have been called into
requisition for the embellishments, and the result is very
creditable to both. Although the building is not large, it
has the lower story arranged for machinery, with a large
water-wheel on the side of the house, but so covered as not
to attract the attention of one taking an outside view of
the building. This structure is an ornament to the place,
and indicates progress in the architectural designs of the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were shown here a plan of the lands belonging to
this fazenda, which had been executed by the above-named
engineer. It displays all the different kinds of soil, with
the distinction of growth upon each; the campo lands
having a very scanty and scrubby growth, the matto
virgem being covered with the large original forest trees,
and the capoeira with small trees that have sprung up on
land which was formerly under cultivation. It is a large
colored map, evidently made with great care, after a regular
survey of the premises, made by contract with the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast we rode out to take an extended view of
the lands under cultivation, and the woodlands that lay
convenient for observation. On the way, we passed the
houses occupied by the colonists employed on this place,
and I counted twenty-four double houses, making forty-eight
tenements, for the separate families. Each family has
a piece of ground attached to the house, or located at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>convenient distance, so that corn and vegetables may be
grown for their own use.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contract with the proprietor only requires their services
in gathering coffee from the trees, and for this labor
they are paid what is considered to be one-half the value
of the crude berries that are gathered. The estimate
placed upon an alqueric—corresponding to our bushel—of
the crude coffee berries, is seventy-five cents; and unless
the crop is good, ordinary hands do not gather more than
two bushels per day. Yet when the trees are very full, and
the person is industrious and skilful, from five to eight
bushels may be gathered in one day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands planted in coffee at this place are not of the
best quality, and yet the crop seems to have been fair,
judging from those trees which have not yet been gathered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The corn and beans being but little above the ground, no
estimate can be formed as to what the crop may be; and
the same in regard to rice which has been planted. But
the general impression received from riding through the
plantation was not particularly favorable to its fertility,
nor does the ground lie favorably for cultivation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rode through a large body of woodland, which gave
indications of a fair quality of soil, and lay very advantageously
for cultivation. Yet it is not of that purple
aspect which characterizes the best soil; and I do not see
upon this place any of the terra rocha which abounds at
Ybicaba. I was led to infer that this was perhaps the
most favorable view which could be taken of the premises,
as my proposition to traverse the territory in another direction,
in the afternoon, did not meet the acquiescence
of Senor Vergueiro, and yet he proposes to sell a part or
the whole of this extensive tract of land. He does not
make known his terms, and I don’t think that any portion
of the vast area of this fazenda fulfils the conditions for a
desirable settlement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Carvalho, an old gentleman of sixty-five years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of age, is the administrator at Angelica; and seems to be
treated with much respect by the proprietor. He is regarded
as the best authority respecting persons or places
within twenty miles of this fazenda, and has rendered us
important service in these respects. His wife is a young,
hale, buxom woman, who looks as if she might welcome
another husband at the demise of this frail old man. She
did not take a seat at the table with us, nor did she make
her appearance often in the room. The women of this
medium class of people have not usually presented themselves
when we have visited their houses, nor are they ever
seen at the table during meals.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wrote a long communication from this place for the
information of my friends, which was sent to my wife, along
with a private letter to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having secured a guide for the various parts of the
country which we expected to visit, we left Angelica this
morning, and came a distance of twelve miles to the fazenda
of Senor João Ribeiro de Santos Carmargo. A
letter from him was given to his administrator, Senor Antonio,
who seemed at the outset to be at a loss what disposition
to make of us and our rather large retinue. Ere
long, however, we got into the house, and our baggage
being brought in, he gave directions for the care of the
stock. We soon found, also, that arrangements were in a
state of progress for giving us dinner, which proved to be
a good substantial meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon he conducted us to a portion of woodland,
also to a field planted recently with coffee trees, and
having a crop of corn and beans interspersed with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was surprised to find this soil very superior to that
about the location of the building, and was impressed with
the importance of making a thorough investigation of the
adjacent territory. We went in a southeasterly direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to the foot of the serra, through a virgin forest of three miles
in extent, and most of the growth indicated fruitfulness of
the soil. At this point, the land under cultivation presented
a good appearance, and the old corn-stalks showed a good
result for the past year. There was also between this and
the woods some open pasture, which had a fine crop of
grass, and we suggested that our animals be sent here to
graze, while we should be furnished from the fazenda for
to-morrow’s ride.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mounted upon the plantation-mules, we rode at an early
hour with Senor Antonio to visit the plantation, which runs
along the foot of the serra, in an easterly direction from
the site of the houses. The coffee trees were the chief objects
of interest, and presented the aspect of vigorous development.
Most of them had been stripped entirely or
partially, and no correct opinion could be formed as to their
yield from the statements of the man in charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>A small piece of land had been planted last year in cotton,
and the stalks, which had been cut off preparatory to
another crop, indicated only a moderate development.
There was a considerable extent of ground open for pasture
that lay favorably for cultivation, and from the size of
the old, deadened trees still standing upon it, the prospect
would be good for a yield of cotton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within a half-mile from the foot of the serra, for more
than a mile in length, the soil was of a reddish aspect, with
a considerable proportion of sand, and as it receded beyond
this distance from the serra, the increase of sand was such
as to render the soil unproductive.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all directions around the houses of this fazenda a barren
campo extends to a considerable distance, and the land
is not even suitable for pasture, as the grass which grows
upon it is not eaten by the horses or cows to any extent,
nor does it prove nutritious.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>After returning from this visit to the coffee field, we were
joined by Major Manuel Reginaldo de Morars Salles, who
breakfasted with us, and then showed us another extensive
portion of the lands. Taking the main road towards the
southeast, upon which we started yesterday evening, we
continued upon it, as the boundary of the land, for two
miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the trees growing along this line, for more than
a mile from the point of divergence yesterday evening, were
large and numerous, yet the sand predominated in an increasing
ratio, rendering the soil of little value. We then
travelled for three miles through a barren campo, constituting
the border of the tract, when a virgin forest was
entered, through which we rode about half a mile into the
better quality of land near the serra. Here the land was
productive, but was very irregular, and liable to wash under
cultivation, as there was more or less sand mixed with it.
We did not find here, as at the northern portion of the
serra, that dark red soil which always has more solidity than
the sandy soil, and, hence, less liability to wash away by
the rains.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this point we emerged, on a different line from that
by which we entered, and soon encountered a sterile region
following round the border of the tract for a mile, through
a complete waste of sandy campo land.</p>

<p class='c007'>We at length came to a considerable stream, upon which
there is an advantageous site for machinery, and were the
better quality of lands near this point, the facility for securing
this fine water-power would constitute quite a recommendation
to the place. But the desirable lands are all at
some miles distance, and a very bad route for the construction
of roads from them to this point. We encountered at
a house here a grove of delicious oranges, upon which we
all feasted to our utmost capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reviewing the impressions of yesterday evening and to-day,
I would conjecture that this body of land extends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>about six miles in length from northwest to southeast,
and that its average width from the serra was two and a
half miles, making nine thousand and six hundred acres of
land. Of this, I would consider one-third as utterly worthless,
and another third as only suited for pasturage, while
the remaining three thousand and two hundred acres is
good land, and lies advantageously for cultivation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The administrator stated that there were seventy thousand
(70,000) coffee trees bearing fruit, and twenty thousand
(20,000) trees which have been planted at different
times within the past two years, while there are ten
thousand (10,000) plants recently set out. Of course, the
value of the property is increased by the growth of these
coffee trees, as every tree bearing fruit makes an annual income,
and the estimated value of each plant when it commences
to yield is twenty cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The territory over which we have passed has many small
streams of water convenient to the different sections of the
land, and the water was clear and pleasant to drink.</p>

<p class='c007'>The land under cultivation lies in two separate localities,
and yet both near the serra. The most elevated grounds in
this country seem to be the most fertile, having, in the best
localities, a dark red loamy soil; while the level lands,
either in low flats or in plateaus, are composed largely of
sand, and have little adaptation to agricultural purposes.
The chief growth upon the campos are a harsh grass and
a wild fern, with here and there a few scrubby trees of small
size.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>We arose at daylight this morning and getting a cup of
coffee rode five miles through campo lands, to the Rio Roque,
(River Rock.) At the point visited another small stream,
with a five-mile site, runs into this river; and should any
one locate near this place it would be available for machinery
requiring but little water-power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Antonio Rodriguez Foone, the administrator, who
was specially charged with the duty of showing us these
lands, referred to an old woman living in a house near by,
and was told by her that the lands beyond the Rio Roque
belonged to the property; and as he supposed the property
extended up the western side, we preferred to explore this
without crossing the river. We rode up for nearly a mile,
and found that the nature of the soil and the configuration
of the surface were very well adapted for cultivation. The
timber upon it is large, and much of it having a long,
straight trunk, which would adapt it admirably for building.
The soil near the road is of that dark red loamy
order which is considered the most productive in the
country. This taken in connection with the more elevated
woodlands lying on the opposite side of the stream, would
form a good settlement for several families, and the general
aspects are favorable for health.</p>

<p class='c007'>After returning from this visit we passed through a body
of land lying in a southwest course from the buildings, and
about one mile distant. It lies very favorably, and is evidently
superior to most of the lands on this place. The soil
is that dark red loam which constitutes terra rocha, and the
timber is much the same as that of the land described upon
the Roque. If there is any considerable extent of these
lands they would form an offset to the larger proportion of
worthless land belonging to this fazenda. On this point,
as on others connected with dimensions, our guide could
give me no information, so that I am left to the broad
domain of surmise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>In forming an approximate estimate of the lands traversed
this morning, I am without any other criterion than the
probabilities based upon what I saw and what Senor Antonio
supposed to be the outline of the fazenda.</p>

<p class='c007'>The figures used in my calculation for the other portion
of the land will correspond very well to my ideas of the
extent of territory here, and we may say it is six miles long
by two and a half miles wide, making nine thousand six
hundred acres. The land previously spoken of lies westward
and northward from the houses, and making a line
from the southern end of the serra across by the buildings
to the boundary, leaves all the land south and east to be
included in the observation of this morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>This entire area does not perhaps contain over two thousand

that cannot be made available for any practical object, save

sand accumulated on this barren waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left Morro Grande, the fazenda of Senor João, and
went twenty miles northwest to the house of Captain
Feliciana.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Having enjoyed the plain and substantial hospitality of
our old friend the Capitão, as men who are hungry and
tired always do, we saw no reason for detention during the
day, and set out at an early hour, accompanied by our host,
to the fazenda of Senor Dom Francisco Antonio de Sonza
Queiroz.</p>

<p class='c007'>A dignified and yet courteous reception was soon followed
by the assignment to very comfortable quarters, and the
furnishing of a most excellent breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>His own wife, and the wife of Senor Dom Francisco
Aguiar de Barros, graced the table with their presence; and
the style of every thing indicated the refinement and elegance
of the families. The gentlemen were so situated at
the table as to separate their wives from the guests, which
seems to be one of the relics of the olden times that clings
to the people of the best class.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two gentlemen own lands adjoining each other,
and both having recently opened up their fazendas, Dom
Barros has not yet got his buildings arranged for his residence;
and his wife being a sister of Dom Queiroz the
families are living together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every thing about the establishment is conducted with
much neatness and good taste; and the dinner table, with
its rich service of silver and variety of dishes, had an air of
completeness that would do credit to any society. Our
tea-table, also, was a type of the best order of things; and,
though the ladies left before the retiring of the gentlemen,
it must have been a great relief to get away when not partaking
in the conversation. With this class of people tea
is not served until half-past eight o’clock; and after the
table is cleared the party sit around and chat until the
hour of retiring for the night. When a social group are
thrown with one another at tea, this is doubtless very
pleasant; but not understanding much that was said on
the part of others, and disliking to call upon Mr. Bennaton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to interpret commonplace remarks either from myself or
others, I found this tarrying around the tea-table quite a
patience-trying ordeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observe here, as elsewhere, that there is a long, slim
pole erected in the front yard, with an emblem of some
saint on a piece of cloth in a frame, attached to the top of
the pole. They are called saint-poles, and the figure is
changed in commemoration of each particular saint’s day.</p>

<p class='c007'>At every house that has been passed or visited, without
distinction of the class of people, where Roman Catholics
reside, this emblem of their faith is to be seen. Though
the figures are usually of the most uncouth aspect and
clumsy execution, it is supposed that holy associations
cling around them, and they are retained even when tattered
and defaced by the elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this it is particularly becoming to
refer to the habit among the negroes, which has attracted
my attention at several of the fazendas, and which was
observed here this evening. After the forming of all in a
line, for the purpose of counting them at night, they repaired
to the rear apartment of the building, occupied by
the family, and all kneeling down they rehearsed a religious
service, in which they were lead by one of their number.
After this all retired to their respective lodgings for the
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observed that a similar proceeding was conducted in
the yard where the negroes were mustered or formed into
line, at the fazenda of Senor João Robiero de Santos Carmargo,
and it is doubtless a part of the routine whenever
any considerable number of negroes are collected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were it really a service of the heart, and not a mere outward
ceremony, there would be an appropriateness and
impressive solemnity in thus looking to God for his blessing
at the close of the day’s labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while a few of the number may have some sense of
reverence for God associated with this daily observance, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>is evident that the greater part join in it as a mere matter
of routine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mustering and counting of the negroes at night is
usually done in front of the residence of the owner, and he
thus has the assurance that all are present. I learn that
the habit of running away is not uncommon here, and at
some places the sound of the shackles has been heard
when the negroes were assembled, though nothing of the
kind was brought to my attention in this establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances the shackles are put on their ankles
only at night to keep them in their quarters, while in others
they are kept on while at work as a matter of punishment,
and I saw at one fazenda a very old woman with shackles
on her ankles while she was employed in stirring the coffee
that was drying. She had been guilty of poisoning other
negroes, and was regarded as a very dangerous person to
go at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>My observation of slavery in this country leads me to the
conclusion that the exactions from the negro are greater,
and the provision for his subsistence and comfort less than
was experienced formerly in the United States.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After a pleasant rest for the night, we were regaled this
morning before rising with a most excellent cup of coffee,
which, it will be observed, is a part of the hospitality in
every well-regulated household.</p>

<p class='c007'>In due course of time our breakfast came, and, along with
other articles, we enjoyed “Café corn leite” and excellent
corn bread, made of fine meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>This “Café corn leite” is prepared by boiling the milk
with the coffee, and is so great an improvement upon the
simple mixture of milk or cream with coffee that it ought
to be resorted to generally by our people who are fond of
this combination for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being supplied with horses by our host, we rode out with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>him to see his newly-opened plantation, called Fazenda
Nova, passing in our route the site he has selected for building
upon, whenever time is allowed for erecting a family
residence. His brickyard and saw-mill are in successful
operation, and the latter is a well-arranged perpendicular
saw, that performs admirably, even in the hard material of
the timber in all this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have as yet seen no instance of a circular saw in operation
here, and it certainly would be better adapted to the
compact and hard wood which has to be encountered in
sawing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coffee trees on this place have all been set out within
the past two years, and some of them have been planted
very recently. In all there are one hundred and forty
thousand, and the number is still to be extended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands under cultivation are, for the most part, elevated,
and of the dark red terra rocha, being of very superior
quality for the coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>We visited also the newly-opened fazenda<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a> of Senor
Dom Barros, and I there had the opportunity of witnessing
the burning of a “roça,” or new ground, of twelve acres,
upon which the timber had been simply felled and partially
dried. The land being scraped around to prevent extension
of the fire, all the negroes were posted at regular intervals
to guard the progress of the conflagration, and the fallen
timber was then fired in various places.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was an interesting sight, as illustrating the custom of
all the planters in Brazil for preparing their lands to receive
the seed for the first time; and, with the heat of a boiling
sun, in addition to the heat of the fire, I found that “distance
lends enchantment to the view.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In riding through the sun to-day I was more affected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>its heat than at any time previously, and though it may
look something like adopting the doctrine of “Similia
similibus curantur,” I resorted to the use of strong coffee,
with decidedly good result. At the new structure of Senor
Barros we found excellent coffee prepared for us, and with
a sense of depression from my exposure to the hot sun, I
drank two cups of the ordinary size in the United States,
which relieved me greatly; and, upon going out again, I
did not experience so much inconvenience from the heat,
though the sun was beaming down its rays with even greater
intensity than before. This stimulant evidently lessened
the influence of the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thermometer stands to-night at 80° Fahrenheit, and
was doubtless 90° at two o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, as it is very sensibly
cooler since the sun disappeared, while a pleasant breeze
always fans the earth at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some valuable information was received from Dom Queiroz
to-day, in regard to the employment by contract, of men
having negroes under their control, from the province of
Minas. These negroes have been heretofore employed
upon coffee estates which have ceased to be profitable in
that section, and the owners are sending them to this comparatively
new region, under responsible overseers, to contract
with the landowners for their labor. They go into
the virgin forest, clear it up after the style of the country,
and plant young coffee trees furnished by the landowner,
which are to be cared for, and the intervening space of land
cultivated on their own account during four years; at the
end of which time, the field is turned over to the owner,
with the coffee trees yielding fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consideration of this service, the landowner pays to the
contractor twenty cents for each coffee tree which is growing
and ready to yield; and if any cash is advanced to him
prior to the end of the fourth year, he gives guarantees for
the fulfilment of his stipulation, and pays twelve per cent.
per annum interest upon the money thus received. The contractor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>supplies himself with tools, and his hands with
provisions, or other articles needed, so that the landowner
is not responsible in any way for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the first two years, the contractor may plant
whatever crop he chooses between the rows of the coffee
trees, but the owner has the right to dictate what shall be
planted in the subsequent two years; and as the growth of
the plants may be impaired by the presence of high corn
or other things calculated to shade them, these may be
forbidden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should the coffee commence yielding before the expiration
of the four years, the contractor obligates himself to
gather the crop, and turn over one-half of it to the owner
of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantage to the contractor consists in having the
use of land for four years, in consideration of clearing it,
and the twenty cents per tree is very full pay for the labor
and attention bestowed upon the coffee plants.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the owner, having a large amount of
land without sufficient force to do all this heavy work, gets
his land put in good order for cultivation, and has the coffee
trees upon it bearing fruit. Considering that four hundred
and sixteen (416) trees grow upon one acre of ground, his
improved land costs him eighty-three dollars ($83) per
acre; and the question arises, could not day-laborers have
been employed throughout this period for the same outlay
of money, who would have given the owner the annual return
from the cultivation of the lands, in addition to the
final growth of the coffee trees?</p>

<p class='c007'>I learn that one man can clear and plant in the course
of a year ten acres of land, and the same man can of course
cultivate it in a crop of provisions during subsequent
years. This man can be hired to work, and find himself,
certainly at one dollar a day for the working days of the
year, which may be put down at three hundred dollars,
which for four years will be twelve hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>For this amount, I have had my annual provisions from
the land, and my coffee trees are now ready to yield me an
annual crop. If this sum now is reduced by subtracting
the value of the crop for each of the three last years, at
the rate of thirty dollars per acre for each year, making
nine hundred dollars, it leaves but three hundred dollars of
outlay for my coffee trees; or thirty dollars per acre, instead
of the eighty-three dollars per acre paid out by the
system of contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this point of view, it is evident that our friend Dom
Queiroz and others who make this arrangement with the
negro contractors are paying very exorbitant rates of hire.
I have purposely placed the rate of day-labor far above the
rate usually paid in this country; and it is not usual to pay
a caipira or Portuguese more than five dollars a month,
and furnish him lodging and provisions, which in cash outlay
will not exceed one-half of the sum specified in my
calculations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It behooves our people to consider all these things in
making their arrangements, and not fall into any plan of
operations because others are doing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In estimating the increased value of lands, with a full
stand of coffee trees bearing fruit, the calculation may with
more propriety be based upon the estimate of twenty cents
per tree, because you receive an immediate return for the
investment, of from three to six pounds of coffee per tree,
annually, which will be worth, free of all expense, twenty
cents the first year for each tree, and thus repay the entire
outlay.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the incidents of travel in this country has been
encountered to-night, by finding a bicho or chigre embedded
in one of my toes. A little darkey was called to identify
the parasite; and a “tropeiro” extracted it, with the nidus
complete, making a very nice operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving our pleasant associations at Nova Fazenda this
morning, we came in company with Dom Queiroz and Captain
Feliciana to the residence of Senor João Franco da
Morars. He had a most sumptuous breakfast in readiness
for us, which was enjoyed very much after our ride of six
miles across the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Setting out after 10 o’clock, we rode over the land which
this gentleman proposes to sell. The extensive tract of
Babylonia is connected at one point with the land upon
which he resides. The former consists of ten thousand
and two hundred (10,200) acres, and the latter of three
thousand (3,000) acres, making together thirteen thousand
two hundred (13,200) acres of land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of land known as Babylonia consists of the
possessions of a number of persons, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>João Franco da Morars, 3,540 acres; José da Lacerda
Guimarans, 3,600 acres; Aranjo Lima, 420 acres; José
Goncalves, 840 acres; José Estivão, 780 acres; Prudenta,
540 acres; José Ignacio, 252 acres; Bento Ribeiro, 252
acres; and the residence of João Franco da Morars, 3,000
acres.</p>

<p class='c007'>Price of lands in Babylonia, $4.50 per acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Price of residence of Senor João, $5.00 per acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the last-named and the rest of the land there
intervenes partially a portion of another fazenda, called
Quilombo, which it is thought can be had upon similar
terms as the above.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stream Ribeirão dos Negros forms the boundary
for a short distance upon the north of the first-named
tract, and then penetrates the lands of Babylonia; supplying
water convenient to other portions, and having
several considerable falls which might be made available
for any extent of machinery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surface of the land is irregular, and in some parts
mountainous, inclining from either side towards the water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which traverses the entire extent of the lands. Upon the
tract enumerated as that of José Goncalves there is an elevated
plateau of perhaps one hundred acres which lies
favorably, and has a stream of water running across it
through an artificial channel. By means of this small stream
a monjolo is worked at two different places; and the soil is
of good quality, while the site for building is very advantageous.
Upon a portion of this plateau, twenty thousand
(20,000) coffee plants are growing from the seed, which are
two years old and look thriving, but are still small. When
the seed are planted in the places where the tree is to grow,
it is thought to have some advantages; yet the almost universal
custom is to transplant from a nursery the rundas or
young sprouts when they have remained for one year, and
thus the stand is perhaps rendered more certain and uniform.</p>

<p class='c007'>If several families should combine in purchasing these
lands, a hamlet or village might be formed upon the plateau
spoken of, and each have sufficient ground in connection
with their dwellings to raise vegetables and necessary supplies.
Those employed as laborers could be located upon
their respective tracts of land, and thus be separated from
their dwellings. In this way children might have a common
school, and many arrangements for the common benefit
of the families could be made convenient to this site, while
the water could be carried to any point it might be desired.
The soil upon most of the hillsides is of good quality and
free from frost, so as to be suitable for planting coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tobacco was seen growing upon this place, as a second
crop from the stalks which had been previously cut off, and
though the result did not appear favorable, it would repay
the trouble of gathering. This region produces tobacco
very satisfactorily; and the neighboring section of Belem
(a contraction of Bethlehem) is regarded as particularly
well suited for the culture of this plant. The mode of preparing
the tobacco for market, here and elsewhere in the
country, is to work it into a kind of rope, with the hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>that is, coiled round a piece of wood two and a half or three
feet long, so that it may be conveniently shipped upon the
pack-mules. It presents a very dark, oily aspect, as if some
foreign ingredient were used in its preparation, and yet this
is said to be simply the exudation of the juice, which results
from the manipulation. This tobacco is strong, but not
regarded as equal in quality to that manufactured in Virginia;
and my friends who used tobacco attributed this
inferiority to the want of proper treatment in this Brazilian
twist.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other provinces of Brazil, more northward, I am informed
that the leaf-tobacco is packed in bales, and shipped
largely to England and other places, for making segars, or for
other processes of manufacture that enhance its value.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soil and climate are said to be well adapted to the
growth of tobacco in all parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We parted from our old friend Captain Feliciana, the
courteous and kind Dom Queiroz, and our host, Senor
Franco, at nine o’clock this morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Feliciana is a plain, unassuming, genteel person,
who has manifested his regard for us by going the entire
round with us since leaving his own premises, and though
over fifty-five years of age, he manifests considerable activity
in exploring the country, and has really been of much
service to us in communicating information of this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dom Queiroz speak a little English, and relieved my embarrassment
by the gentleness and urbanity of his bearing
towards me during our sojourn at his house and our association
subsequently. When I bade him good-bye, he said,
in terms that required premeditation, with his limited use
of English, “If I can be of any service to you at any time,
call upon me. You will find me here, ready to serve you;
and I am at your orders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Under other circumstances, this might have been viewed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>as a mere passing remark; but, having found him so unassuming
in his hospitality previously, this kindness manifested
at our parting was highly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host, Senor Franco, has manifested the greatest generosity
in supplying our wants, and also in providing for
our animals and attendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had a very interesting daughter, who had met us at
the outset in the dining-room, and at each meal subsequently,
causing us to take quite an interest in her dignified management
during the indisposition of her mother. When we
were ready to leave the house, Mr. Bennaton asked for her,
and we shook hands with her, and gave her our best wishes
at parting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Franco said that I would come with my friends to
live amongst them, if I knew how much gratification it
would afford the people of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>He kindly sent a negro man with us, to pilot the road,
and we reached the residence of Senor Maj. Joaquim Roberto
de Silveira at 4 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>; we got dinner promptly,
but there being no corn on the place for our stock, he sent
off to a neighbor, and after some hours procured only half a
bushel, which affords but half a feed for night and morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has recently settled this place, and has not yet made
a crop of corn, which explains very satisfactorily his deficiency;
but it was supposed that others in the neighborhood
would have made a crop of corn, and could have responded
to his call in a larger quantity than he procured. In asking
him to procure the corn, Mr. Bennaton expected to pay for
it, but he would receive nothing for it, and accommodated
us, as all have done, in the true spirit of hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>This section of country presents an admixture of campo
and forest lands; the former being a light, sandy, barren
waste; while the latter vary considerably in quality. Most
of the woodland seen to-day was near the premises of our
host, and though it looked as if cotton might be grown
advantageously, there was a large element of sand, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>predisposed it to wash, when there was much irregularity
of surface. It had a dark gray aspect, and corresponded
more to the character of soil seen in some parts of South
Carolina than any land yet seen in Brazil, and may produce
equally well.</p>

<p class='c007'>After an early breakfast, we were supplied with a negro
guide by Major Silveira, and travelling through a region
that was almost entirely campo, we proceeded twelve miles
to the residence of Senor Major José Maria Gavião, at São
José.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his absence, we were kindly received by his family;
and upon his arrival, we had the strongest demonstration
of his generous hospitality. He not only treated us with
the best he had to eat and drink, but supplied us with fine
horses to ride over his plantation.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has only established himself here a few years, and
yet his arrangements are very complete. He has a large
tract of land lying remarkably well for cultivation, and
very fair soil, though not of the best quality. It is free
from frost, and thought to be well suited for coffee culture.
He has one hundred and twenty thousand coffee plants of
different ages already planted, and is ready to extend the
number when he has rains to favor transplanting.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has a good saw-mill, with perpendicular saw, which
works very satisfactorily. He has also a grist-mill that
makes beautiful corn-meal; and really it is refreshing to
see the meal instead of farina, which is the substitute in
most of the parts of the country for bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>We availed ourselves of the fine bathing facilities at the
mill to refresh our persons, and put on clean clothes. The
Major sent down large towels for us, and provided likewise
a bottle of Cognac, for us to take a little after concluding
the bath, to prevent any bad effects of the cold water.
Bathing in this climate is not only very grateful to our
bodies but it is regarded essential to health and comfort.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>I here had an opportunity of enjoying for the first time
a feast of that delicious fruit, the jaboticaba. It is a large,
dark purple fruit, resembling very much the appearance
and taste of the finest specimens of muscodine, but the
average size is somewhat larger than the largest muscodine,
and the juice is even sweeter and more delicate than
that of the muscodine. It is regarded entirely free from
danger, when the juice alone is eaten, and many swallow the
pulp also without experiencing any inconvenience. This
fruit is an anomaly in its location upon the body of the
trees, or upon the larger limbs, by a very short, delicate
attachment, and is not found upon the twigs or ends of the
branches as other fruits. The tree producing it is a tall,
smooth, light-yellow colored forest growth; and in riding
out to the woods, a negro ascended one of them and
gathered a quantity of the fruit. It grows also when
transplanted, and makes a beautiful shade-tree for a yard,
while bearing the choicest fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>I ate at the house, likewise, the cassia, which is a fruit
produced in the campos, and has a very pleasant acidulous
taste, that is found very good when used as a lemonade
with water. This fruit has the peculiarity of producing the
seed at the lower end, exterior to the investment. Though
found upon a small shrub in the campo, it is grown under
cultivation upon a large tree, and of much larger size and
finer flavor.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were shown here a small hand-roller cotton-cleaner,
which is the only reliance thus far for a gin. A small
spinning jinney of the old pattern is also used; and the
mortar and pestle are employed for beating big hominy.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rode out this morning before breakfast to the location
of a small colony of Brazilians, employed by Major
Gavião in cultivating his lands. Most of them own some
slaves, and they are also employed upon the place. As the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>sole object in these arrangements seems to be for the coffee
culture, the contract with the proprietor leaves them free
to cultivate the intervening ground for themselves, and the
consequence is, that their cribs are full of corn, while the
proprietor has to buy his supply from the country around.
They have hogs, also, in fine order, and every thing about
their little settlement looks to be in a thriving state. In
addition to this, the laborer is paid five cents per year for
each coffee plant that he sets out and gets to growing, thus
having a good cash income, independent of the supply of
provisions. This principle works well for the contractor,
but is certainly not favorable for the landowner, as he certainly
should avail himself of some part, at least, of the
productions of the land, during the period it is occupied by
the contractor or colonist, as he is, in this instance.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observed at the house of Major Gavião a negro man
with an indolent ulcer of the hand, which he was treating
with acid nitrate of mercury, in the absence of any physician.
I thought this quite heroic domestic practice, yet it
was evidently a proper application, and I indorsed his
treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negroes here, as at other places, were observed to
labor in ditching without their shirts; and though this
strikes one strangely upon first seeing it, the negro evidently
consults his own comfort, as the shirt is usually tied
round the waist. So far as I have had an opportunity of
examining the clothing of negroes, the men wear a substantial
shirt and pants of coarse cotton, and it is rare that
one has been seen with ragged clothes. The women usually
wear lighter material, and it is not uncommon to see a
female servant about a house with an old calico dress,
which has doubtless been cast aside by the white women of
the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was particularly impressed here with the freedom which
was allowed some negro children in coming into the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>occupied by the family, and with the attention given them
by the Major.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having no children of his own, he seems to make pets of
these little darkies. He has likewise a number of huge
dogs, which are very fond of lying about the house, and he
tolerates them at times, but at others makes a clearing out
of every thing, and closes an open-work door, which serves
as a barrier to their entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a late breakfast, the dashing Major accompanied
us a short distance, and left us with a guide to show us the
route to the fazenda of Senor Dom Rafael Aguiar Paes de
Barros.</p>

<p class='c007'>He and his fine-looking wife received us most courteously
and treated us very kindly. Upon being informed that I
wished to look at any lands in the neighborhood which
might be for sale, the Dom supplied us with horses, and
rode with us to see some lands near his place. The soil
appeared to be of superior quality, and the surface was
remarkably smooth and level for this country, but there is
not such a supply of springs as would be desirable for the
use of families, and the only stream available for machinery
is of small capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands are bounded upon one side by the Rio Jacaré,
the margins of which are said to be very liable to chill and
fever, and have not been cleared up for cultivation. There
is not sufficient fall in any part of this stream adjacent to
the land for establishing any kind of machinery.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, however, an immense salto or water-fall upon
the river Chimbarro, which runs near one end of the territory,
but belongs to another party, who manifests no wish
to sell. This water-power might be used for machinery of
any magnitude, and the location would be a good one for
a cotton factory, to work up the crude material of the
country, and sell the proceeds to the people within adjoining
districts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The following are the tracts of land in the market:</p>

<table class='table0'>

    <td class='c009'>João Baptista Lacenda</td>
    <td class='c010'>6,000 acres.</td>

    <td class='c009'>The last can be bought for about</td>
    <td class='c010'>$2,500.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'>These lands lie in juxtaposition to each other, so that
they would together form a fine large plantation, and one
good settlement, or perhaps more could be secured. The
average of the whole makes the price one dollar and twenty
cents per acre, and I have seen no body of land presenting
such favorable conditions for a fazenda, though not adapted
to a number of small settlements.</p>

<p class='c007'>This territory lies eight miles south of Araraquara, and
a considerable proportion of the two last-named tracts have
been at one time cleared and under cultivation. But it is
evident that it was not materially impaired, and it is again
covered with a growth of taquara (a species of cane) and
small trees of various kinds, which would be much more
readily cleared off than the original forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>This land is said to have been planted seven years ago
in corn and beans, for the purpose of fattening hogs to be
driven to market; but this trade being no longer profitable,
it was abandoned, and the land allowed to grow up as
stated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The altitude of this region renders it very pleasant for a
residence, and yet its exemption from frost enables the
coffee to be cultivated successfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dom Barros has already a portion of land adjoining
these lands planted in coffee, which looks to be thriving
well, though not old enough to bear fruit. I saw upon his
place corn-stalks, that indicated its adaptation to this important
crop, and pumpkins of good size were also seen in
the field amongst the corn. He cultivates the sugar-cane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>very successfully, and has a large mill, in which he is constantly
working it, with a firm yield of sugar and rum.
The molasses is very little made anywhere I have been,
and yet when produced is of the very finest quality. It is
not used as we use it, in connection with the substantials
of a meal, but is confined to use with the dessert, and is a
most delicious syrup.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the water-power upon the Chimbarro can be secured,
in connection with these lands, it then becomes a very desirable
investment, and as Dom Barros brings the water
for his machinery from this stream, through a race two miles
long, it may be that a privilege could be had from the owner,
though he may not sell the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>After an excellent dinner, at which Senorha presided,
much after the style of our southern ladies, we were supplied
with a guide by Dom Barros, and came to the villa of Araraquara.
Having a letter to Senor Manuel Francisco de
Oliveira, we were kindly received and well provided for at
his house. I was informed that a letter had been addressed
to me by the municipal authorities of this place, inviting
me to visit the district, and that the people throughout the
country were very desirous that we should select a location
amongst them. Several gentlemen called upon us, and
among them the municipal Judge, to whom I had a letter of
introduction—Senor Dom Andre Dias de Aguiar. This gentleman
impressed me very favorably by his courteous manner
and his intelligent expression of countenance, while he
manifested quite an interest in the objects of my visit, and
my personal gratification.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villa of Araraquara is located upon a plateau, which
affords ample scope for extension of the town; and there is
a clear bold brook running on one side of it, which affords
fine water for domestic purposes and for the use of all kinds
of stock. The streets are laid off at right angles, with a
church and an open space in front of it in the centre of the
population. I observed that there was a jail opposite the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>church, and yet I was informed that it was not much in
demand for criminals. The style of architecture is similar
to the mud-built houses seen elsewhere, being nearly all of
a single story, and consequently spread over a large area,
when any considerable house-room is secured. The drinking
water here is superior, and the climate very pleasant.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Senor Candido Mariano Barba, the government agent at
this place, called upon us early this morning, and manifested
a desire to aid me in any way it might be practicable.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It being arranged that we should go out to the fazenda
of Senor Lenente Coronel Joaquim Lorenço Correa, several
of the gentlemen of the villa rode out with us. Meeting the
proprietor on the way, he joined us and conducted us to his
extensive and well-arranged establishment, known as São
Lorenço. On the way, we passed a beautiful cascade of
several hundred feet in height, and then another near his
place, which is also a fall of great elevation, but not containing
so much water as the former. The lands adjacent to
these water-falls are comparatively level, but drop down
suddenly in a gorge, whose banks are precipitous for a considerable
distance, as the stream descends. I observed this
same thing on the premises of Dom Barros, and it is rather
a striking peculiarity of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fazenda of Senor Joaquim is four miles from the villa,
and passing in part through red campo land, the forest is
entered within a mile of the residence, and the soil here is of
superior quality. The best sugar-cane yet seen was observed
on the roadside as we approached the residence, and
I learned from the owner that it had been growing several
years from the original roots. He finds that the cane produces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>here, satisfactorily, six years; and after that time it
is customary to plant the ground anew.</p>

<p class='c007'>This establishment belongs to the first class of the country,
and the dwelling is located upon a gentle slope, with a paved
terrace, elevated to correspond to the level of the house.
The residence is very commodious, with a basement story,
which adds greatly to convenience, and the general reception
room is supplied with sofas and chairs, having cane
seats, and of very neat workmanship. The usual plan of
having the sleeping apartment opening into the parlor is
found here also, and there is no ventilation excepting by
this door. The outbuildings are well-arranged and of the
most substantial construction, and the yard immediately
around the house is inclosed with a fence, while outside of
this there extends for half a mile on one side a most luxuriant
grass-pasture.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a short distance from the dwelling stands a grist-mill,
saw-mill and sugar-mill, moved by water, which is brought
in a race from an adjacent stream. The sugar-house is
supplied with metallic cylinders to express the juice of the
cane, and the quantity extracted gives a favorable idea of
the richness of the growth of cane, while the syrup indicates
by its taste a large proportion of saccharine matter. He
has three large boilers of sheet copper placed in a furnace
that is neat and substantial, while it works most efficiently.
There are small troughs connecting these boilers with the
large receiving-troughs, in which the syrup stands to crystallize,
and the process of transforming the syrup is thus
attended with little difficulty. After the sugar has formed,
it is then placed in other receivers with perforations in the
bottom, so that it drips and becomes dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sugar is then submitted to a process of clarifying by
covering it with a compost of clay and cow-dung, which
seems to act favorably in rendering the superficial layers of
sugar very fair, and indeed almost white. This is entirely
new to me, and yet may have been resorted to in the sugarmaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>regions of the United States without coming to my
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The drippings from the sugar are converted into rum,
which is known here by the name of aqua-ardente, or cachaça,
and this branch of the business is quite profitable, as
a market is found in the country near at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sale, however, of most of the sugar made at this
establishment, is readily effected in this and the adjoining
districts, at the prices of Rio with addition of transportation;
so that, though laboring under the apparent disadvantage
of remoteness from any established market, there
is really a very decided benefit in this location. He gets a
higher price at his sugar-house than the manufacturers who
ship to Rio or Santos can possibly get at those points, as
his consumers must pay for the transportation on pack-mules,
if they should go there to purchase. Moreover, I
am strongly impressed with the conviction that the cane
and the appliances used in this establishment, with the
high-toned character of the proprietor, will furnish inducements
to buyers that may not be found elsewhere. He
produces annually for the market between eighty and ninety
thousand pounds of sugar, for which he gets an average of
seven and a half cents per pound. Let us make a calculation
for eighty-five thousand pounds at seven and a half
cents per pound, and it gives $6,375, from which deduct
$1,375 for expenses, and we have five thousand dollars profit.</p>

<p class='c007'>He employs only about fifteen hands, and raises besides
all the corn, beans, and other provisions for his family, and
also all the hogs which are required on his place. Every
thing which can make life comfortable seems to be raised in
the greatest abundance on this place, and he lives to a large
extent within himself; but yet avails himself likewise of
such importations as are requisite for success in working his
fazenda, or for the comfort of his family. His family consists
of seven daughters and five sons, and when one is married,
or arrives at the age of twenty-one years, he gives this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>son or daughter three thousand dollars upon which to commence
business. Four of his daughters are married, and
two of his sons, while one of his sons being in the military
service at the seat of war, leaves at home three daughters
and two sons. The entire family excepting the older son
at home, present a very robust and healthy aspect, and the
constitutional stamina of the old gentleman and old lady
are not surpassed in any country. The son at home, whose
health suffered in the army, so that he was discharged from
service, is now recovering his vigor, but has not the appearance
of a good constitution like the rest of the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party rode out in the afternoon to visit the coffee
field (cafézar) of his son-in-law, Senor Francisco de Paula
Coma e Silva. He has some twenty thousand trees of various
ages, and those most advanced indicating good development,
with a fair prospect for a yield. But he could
give us no definite idea of the past crop.</p>

<p class='c007'>We here regaled with oranges and bananas of the finest
quality, and coffee was also handed at the house.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During the morning I was requested to prescribe for a
little son of Senor Francisco, and as there was no medicine
in the house suited to the case, we rode to the town to learn
if iodine, iodide of potash, and syrup of sarsaparilla could
be found at the apothecary shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the articles fortunately were on hand, and the keeper
of the shop promised to have the medicine ready to-morrow
morning. After calling upon several parties in the villa,
we were entertained with music on the accordeon by a dark-skinned
gentleman, while a parrot was paraded upon the
table and supposed to be marching in time to the music, of
which, however, I could not have a full appreciation. As
will be perceived, this was a Sunday exercise, and in the
mean time our old friend, Senor Joaquim, went out to attend
mass.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>After returning to São Lorenço, the camarada was sent
to the villa for our baggage, which had been left behind the
day previous.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon I was summoned by Mr. Bennaton to
join a party who were going out, and found they were preparing
for a hunt. I was offered a gun, and the gentlemen
of the family were very much surprised at my refusal to
accept it, as they had previously understood that I was fond
of shooting. Though I declined the gun, the Sabbath was
violated by accompanying the huntsmen on horseback.
Several shots were fired by different members of the party,
at a species of partridge nearly as large as a chicken, but
no game was secured, and a shower of rain induced a precipitate
return to the house. I told them it was a judgment
sent upon us for violating the Sabbath, and resolved not to
be again lead into such a departure from my sense of duty.
Fortunately our baggage had arrived and afforded us dry
clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after our return, there arrived two visitors from
the villa, who were also quite wet, and had to avail themselves
of a supply of dry clothes from our host and his son.
One of these gentlemen was Senor Dom Aguiar, Municipal
Judge, and the other was Senor Lenente Coronal Antonio
Carlos de Arruda Botilho, who owns a large fazenda some
thirty miles distant, at which he resides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having friends and business relations with this place, this
latter gentleman is frequently in the villa of Araraquara,
and is held in good repute by those residing in the neighborhood.
With these people a ride of thirty miles is a small
matter, as they frequently set out at or before daylight, and
make the distance upon a good mule before breakfasting.
From the lateness of the hour at which these gentlemen
came, I suppose they expected to remain for the night, and
now since they have changed their own clothes for others
belonging to the family, there is no alternative. The social
relations among people in this country who are on a basis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of equality seems to be accompanied with great freedom of
intercourse, and liberty in their deportment about the dwellings
of each other, while nothing like rudeness, or want of
proper personal respect, has attracted my attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>While it is my purpose to record as far as practicable
every thing which may illustrate the industrial resources of
Brazil, it also appears to be proper that I should give such
incidents as may serve to give an idea of the manners and
customs of the people, and this must be done in some cases
by implicating myself in scenes that do not comport with
my views of propriety, as to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>A letter from the President of the province of São Paulo
being received by Mr. Bennaton, from which he inferred
that General W. W. W. Wood, of Mississippi, needed his
assistance on the way to this point, he proposed to return
for the purpose of meeting him. I declined to accompany
him, and told him it would suit me better to remain in this
vicinity, for the purpose of examining such places as might
be conveniently visited during his absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>My old friend, Colonel Joaquim Lorenço, invited me to
sojourn at his house, and kindly offered to aid me in looking
around the country, or in any other matter that might be
desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>He authorized Mr. Bennaton to say to me that there is a
very comfortable house upon an adjoining place to this,
which he will cheerfully furnish for the use of my family,
and that he will also supply them with provisions and all
other necessaries for living, free of all cost, until some more
satisfactory arrangement can be made for them, and invites
me to bring them here should a purchase be made anywhere
in this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>I returned my most profound thanks for this generous
offer, and felt truly that “a friend in need is a friend indeed.”
As yet, however, I am unable to say whether circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>will permit me to accept the proposition, though
it is evidently tendered in good faith, and with the expectation
that a location for my friends may be found in this
vicinity. I rode out with my host to see the house and
grounds offered for my family, and found every thing more
inviting than most dwellings in this country, with abundant
supply of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bennaton having left, I find myself thrown upon my
own resources in communicating with those around me, and
though attended with much embarrassment and difficulty,
it will serve greatly to advance my knowledge of the Portuguese
language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apparent cheerfulness with which the old Colonel and
other members of the family render me assistance is a great
relief in my awkward efforts to use the few phrases I have
learned. From time to time I have been studying the Portuguese
grammar, but have the misfortune to be provided
with a very badly-arranged and unsatisfactory edition that
was given me by my friend, the Rev. A. L. Blackford, at
São Paulo. It is by E. F. Granert, of Cleveland, Ohio, who
resided for some years in Brazil, but certainly has not acquired
the art of making a grammar to facilitate a knowledge
of the language. I could have made considerable progress
in learning the vocabulary on my voyage across the water,
but regarding the pronunciation of prime consequence, in
the first acquisition of words, I purposely deferred committing
words or phrases to memory, until I could avail myself
of the assistance of persons speaking the language, and thus
get a correct pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am still impressed with the importance of this course,
as none of the rules can enable the learner to get an accurate
idea of the peculiarities of the spoken tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little son of Senor Joas de Almida Leite Morais,
another son-in-law of my host, is at present suffering from
an attack of cholera morbus at São Lorenço, and is under
my treatment. A prescription has been written out, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>sent to the apothecary at the villa, who filled it very satisfactorily,
and all promises well.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Tuesday</span>, <i>October 24, 1865</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>My little patient is entirely relieved by the treatment
instituted on yesterday, and the entire household seem to
be very much gratified at the result of prescription. As
there are no physicians in this district, a few favorable cases
would no doubt be a passport to the confidence of all who
require medical aid. But I can’t entertain the thought of
entering upon a country practice, however profitable it
might prove. And if I locate in this region, it will be with
a view to engage in agricultural operations. Should my
friends from any cause abandon the thought of coming to
Brazil, then I may locate in some city, and enter upon the
practice of my profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>I rode out with Colonel Joaquim to his field this morning,
and got his ideas of the indications of good soil from the appearance
of the earth, and the nature of the growth upon it.
He places most confidence in the presence of the Pon d’Alho
when it is very large, as it then indicates depth of soil,
which nourishes the roots, and gives vigor to the tree. His
lands are chiefly of the terra rocha order, and he agrees
with others in considering this as best suited to coffee and
sugar-cane, and also to the cultivation of corn. He thinks,
however, that the yield of the cotton upon this rich land is
not so favorable as upon a soil with some sand intermixed,
which agrees with the views of others on this subject. His
experience, however, in cultivating cotton, is limited to a
small supply for home consumption, as his fixtures for treating
the sugar render it better for him to continue in that
business, and he could not find sale for cotton nearer than
Santos. He uses the plough to prepare his land for planting
the sugar-cane, and employs the tops of the sound and
vigorous cane from which to grow his crop.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seems to be the plan universally adopted here, instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of planting entire stalks, as is done in the lower parts
of Georgia and Florida; and of course proves an item of
great economy in planting a large area of ground in sugar-cane.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observe, here, that rice is planted in upland, and without
any regard to securing a moist place. The yield is fair,
and the quality of the article very good, though not equal
to Carolina rice. It is grown, to a greater or less extent,
upon most of the fazendas I have visited, but simply for
family consumption; while upon the coast, I am informed,
there are large rice-plantations, that produce it for the
market extensively.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to other industrial enterprises, Senor Joaquim
has a stock-farm in connection with the residence shown
to me yesterday, and there has about twelve hundred head
of cattle which are grown for the market, as well as to supply
the wants of his own family. He has in that place a
large tract of land, of which about ten thousand acres are
in woodland, and twenty thousand acres in campo, furnishing
ample range for his cattle. This has not been a matter
of much concern with him, and the profits are considered
as small in comparison to his other business. Yet, he
thinks, with proper care, it might become valuable; and by
combining the rearing of mules with that of cattle, it would
make a very pretty department of industry for some of our
Southerners who are fond of stock.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>My old friend gave me to understand this morning, that
we would start in the afternoon to make a visit to one of
his daughters, and thence to-morrow to examine some lands
which had already been seen superficially in company with
Dom Barros.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had been guessing his meaning in most of the communications
made to me, from the few words I could understand,
but on this occasion there was no point caught in his first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>presentation of the matter, and upon asking him to repeat
what he said, I managed to infer that it pertained to this
trip, which had been contemplated. My very general reply,
“Eston as suas ordeus,” (I am at your orders,) indicated
my readiness to go whenever it suited him, and on asking
him what time we should start, he indicated 2 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly his wife and three daughters joined us on
horseback, and we rode eight miles to the house of his son-in-law,
Senor Joaquim de Sampaio Peixoto. Here I met
a cordial reception, and found plenty of oranges, with good
cheer, and also comfortable quarters. I observed at this
house a specimen of cattle with shorter and smaller horns
than the stock usually seen in the country, and learned they
were imported. The native cows do not make good milkers,
being very large and coarse, and in common with the males
having most enormous horns. They make good beef, and
furnish large hides, but are not suited for the domestic purposes
of a family. It is stated, indeed, that these immense
oxen are not so serviceable as those of the smaller size
which are found in some parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies mounted and dismounted their horses without
assistance at starting and arriving.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>All our party, accompanied by Senor Peixoto, set out
immediately after breakfast upon horseback. While we
stopped a few minutes to examine a new mill-dam on the
way, we saw a small deer (viado) swimming down the stream,
to make its escape from the dogs which had been pursuing
it above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of taking to the bank, when it reached the dam,
it plunged over the fall, and made its way down by running
in the current, which was no longer deep enough to require
it to swim. The dread of the pursuer kept it from going
upon land, where it might be scented and followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old Colonel went with the ladies directly to the residence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of Dom Barros, while Senor Peixoto very kindly
acted as guide for me in examining the lands. He took me
through the most obscure paths, and to all desired parts of
the territory included in the tracts of Lacerda, Rodrigues,
and Roberto, lying near the Rio Jacaré.</p>

<p class='c007'>My impressions of the quality of these lands were not
materially changed by the inspection, but malarial indications
were presented at several points on the Lacerda tract,
apart from the fixed fact of the unwholesome atmosphere of
the Jacaré river. The quantity of water suited for drinking
purposes was found less than previously anticipated, and
there is no stream upon either of the places suited for any
kind of machinery. The prospect for a location upon these
lands is therefore decidedly unfavorable, though the soil
would yield good crops.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dining with Dom Barros, our party rode back to
São Lorenço, a distance of sixteen miles, without any apparent
inconvenience to the ladies. The physical stamina
of these women is equal to any thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having eaten a great variety of meats and fruits, with
much exposure to the hot sun, I found myself suffering this
morning with some derangement of the bowels, and asked
my old friend if he had any brandy. As he had none, he
gave me some port wine, but this did not relieve me; and
he then gave me a mixture of aqua-ardente (rum) and polvilho
(starch of the mandioca) with a little water and sugar.
It was very strong with the rum and I took but one-half
of the quantity provided. This acted favorably, and is
doubtless well adapted to relieve the relaxation of the intestines
resulting from improper diet in this climate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The amount and quality of my food was changed for this
day to suit my condition; and it seemed to be a source of
much concern to the family that I did not partake of the
many good things prepared for me. Indeed, each of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>three meals was like a dinner in the variety of the articles,
and it required the greatest circumspection to keep from
eating too much.</p>

<p class='c007'>I rode out to the fields again with the old Colonel, and
thus had a little more latitude for practising my vocabulary
of Portuguese; and after returning my time was devoted
industriously to improving my facility in the use of
the language. I read aloud some articles in the newspaper
which had already been learned with the use of the
dictionary, and some difficulties of construction were explained
by the Colonel and his son-in-law. I have also
resorted to reading in the Portuguese Testament, with the
English at hand, so as to assist me in a proper translation,
but this does not seem to improve me so much as the reading
of the articles in the newspapers with my dictionary.
The effort to understand the idiom is a good exercise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although I retired late last night, my sleep was disturbed
by the deranged state of my system, and farther
perhaps by the presence of a vagalume which had been
secured under a glass in the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>This singular lightning-bug is of the size of an ordinary
beetle, and has two luminous spots of considerable brilliancy,
corresponding to the position of the eyes. It imparts
sufficient light to read when held near the printed page;
and the time by a watch is told with great facility when
it is held near the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brother of Senor Joaquim Lorenço, Senor Francisco
Correa de Arruda,<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a> spent the night with us, and impressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>me very favorably as a man of substantial worth and good
sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast I joined the old Colonel in a ride of six
miles to the farm of Senor Joaquim Correa da Assumpsão,
where the best cotton was seen growing that has been encountered
in my tour. It had borne a crop last season
amounting to 2453 pounds in the seed per acre, with a
prospect of an increased yield this year after cutting off
the stalks. The limbs have already sprouted out to some
distance, and are spreading in such form as to make a good
stalk; and the squares, blooms, and forming bolls indicate
a most excellent result. This land has not been ploughed
at any time, and would certainly be improved by cultivation
with the plough.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we were at the house of Senor Assumpsão, a messenger
came to notify the old Colonel of the arrival of
General Wood and party at the villa of Araraquara. We
rode into the villa and found them in charge of some of
the citizens. All took breakfast with Dom Andre Dias da
Aguinar, and as it was nearly 12 o’clock, they evidently
relished his abundant supplies after a ride of sixteen miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon asking General Wood to give me a memoranda of
the names of those constituting his party, the following
list was written and handed to me:</p>

<p class='c007'>General William Wallace W. Wood, lawyer and editor,
of Mississippi, representing seven States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. James H. Warne, surgeon and physician, from Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert L. Brown, planter, Alabama.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Aids.</i>—W. C. Kernan, of Florida, architect and builder;
Dr. J. P. Wesson, Tennessee, dentist and machinist.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Government Aids.</i>—Major Ernest Street, civil engineer,
São Paulo; Henry Snell, interpreter, Campinas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three servants and two mule-tenders; four pack-mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bennaton failed to meet the General’s party on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the road, but returned and joined them at the villa this
morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire cavalcade, accompanied by a number of gentlemen
from the villa, repaired to São Lorenço, with the
proprietor, and enjoyed a most bountiful and well prepared
dinner at 4 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>I had been introduced to General Wood in New Orleans
early in the month of July, and understood from him then
that he was delegated to come to Brazil as the representative
of five hundred families in Mississippi, but as he
was delayed in starting, it seemed to me best that my
movements should not be retarded for the sake of his company,
and I left the city for New York on the 12th of the
month. As I sailed prior to his arrival, there was no further
communication between us until our meeting here, and
it is now found that his commission has been extended so
as to include seven States.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of his party, Mr. Kernan, brought a letter of introduction
to me from Dr. R. P. Daniel, of Florida, in which
he remarks: “I was myself, in connection with another
gentleman from Florida, on my way to Brazil to locate a
colony; circumstances have delayed us so much beyond
the time we had proposed that, considering the difference in
seasons and other matters, we have concluded to return
home and wait until next spring before going on. I regret
this delay very much; meantime, will you not let me hear
from you at your convenience?”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the multiplicity of my engagements, it may not be in
my power to make such a communication to Dr. Daniel as
would be desirable, and the publication of this record will
give him and others who have desired information most of
the facts in my possession connected with this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large number of guests were all comfortably provided
with bedding at São Lorenço, and rose this morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>refreshed, and responded promptly to the call for breakfast,
doing ample justice to the supplies.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was intimated to me that Senor Francisco desired me
to examine and prescribe for his wife, a daughter of our
host; and Mr. Bennaton rode over with us and interpreted
my questions and her answers, so that a full history of the
case was received. It was a stomatitis of two months
standing; and finding a Portuguese medical formulary at
São Lorenço I was enabled to make out a regular recipe,
which was sent to the druggist in the villa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after our return a delegation arrived, representing
the villa and county of Araraquara, who presented
addresses in Portuguese to General Wood and myself.
Our replies were, of course, written in English, but were
rendered into Portuguese by Mr. Bennaton, and presented
to the representatives, who were in attendance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A translation of the address to me, and my answer, will
be given here, in fulfilment of the request contained in their
communication:</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Doctor Gaston</span>:—It is not only the commission under
which you are acting, and by the fulfilment of which Brazil,
developing her immense resources, hopes to attain in a
short time to that degree of importance which providence
has designed, that causes the municipal common council
of this village, interpreting faithfully the sentiments of
their citizens, to come by the delegation which you have
before you, and express the desire that you may find what
you seek; and thus, that your worthy fellow-citizens—our
brothers of the American Union—may adopt our country
for their country. It is likewise the sentiment of sympathy,
doctor, which your manners and education have induced on
the part of all who have had intercourse with you.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remain then, doctor, amongst us, as also your friends,
that you may succeed in obtaining lands, which will be suitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>for your energetic farmers and mechanics; and rest
assured that we will receive you as brothers receive brothers.</p>

bad maxim in morals or in politics; and yet there are certain
relations to others in life, and to the circumstances
by which we are surrounded, that are next to an impossibility
to control. These considerations come to mind
constantly here, and it is proper that they should enter into
the calculations of our people who may think of removing
to this country, as it will be found very difficult to act in
such a way as to overcome the influences at work on all
sides to subvert our views of duty as to the Sabbath.
When a number of like faith and practice are associated
together in one community, they may establish their own
customs and observances; and the importance of locating
together will not subserve this end only, but many other
useful objects for our future welfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Wood and myself, with our party, accompanied
by Colonel Joaquim Lorenço and his son-in-law, Senor
Francisco, left São Lorenço this morning shortly after five
o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> Our object being the exploration of the
fazendas of Lagrada, Cambuy and Monte Allegre, it was
expected that we would be out several days, and provisions
were accordingly made by the old Colonel for all our prospective
wants during the tour.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rode first through a portion of the tract of land known
as Lagrada, containing thirty thousand acres of land, and
belonging to our host, which he proposed to sell if it is desired.
It consists of campo land in two-thirds of its extent,
and the remaining third of forest land. Our route this
morning was through the campo land, in which the soil was
red, and having quite a variety of small trees and shrubs.
Some of those bore fruits, while others were of a medicinal
character. Among the latter were found the trees from
which are procured quinine, manna and India rubber, with
the plants of the jalap, columbo, ipecac, and several indigenous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>remedies for syphilitic diseases and the bites of
venomous serpents. Indeed these plains contain quite a
variety of fruits and medicinal agents, and it is evident
that collections of the latter, having much value, might be
made by one acquainted with their properties and general
aspects.</p>

<p class='c007'>We proceeded through a portion of the lands of Cambuy,
which is said to contain twelve square leagues of territory,
which makes one hundred and twenty-two thousand eight
hundred and eighty acres of land. The proportion of
campo is supposed to be two-thirds to one-third of woodland.
Our route lay through a portion of the woodland,
which is of the terra rocha order, and about two miles
across, to the river Jacaré. Here we found a bridge had
been undertaken, but was not completed, nor did the work
seem to be progressing.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the west of this, some half a mile, there empties the
Rio da Fazendinha, which conveys sufficient water for motive
power, and has a fall of great extent, less than a mile
from its mouth. The Rio da Montada and the Rio João
Velho are smaller streams, which empty into the Jacaré
farther westward.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a serra running up and down the Jacaré, and
nearly parallel with the general course of the stream, having
the crest about two miles distant and sloping gradually
on each side; upon that slope next the river chill and fever
is said to be generated, while near the crest and upon the
opposite slope it is stated to be exempt from all disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands upon this serra are said to be of the best
quality, and if they correspond throughout to the soil seen
near the road, there is every reason to anticipate a good
result from their cultivation. Until some proper and reliable
measurement is made of this fazenda, no idea can be
formed of the extent of this body of woodland, yet it is
certainly the most valuable territory of the entire tract.
If it be two leagues long, and one league wide, as some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>estimate it to be, it would form a very valuable acquisition
for agricultural operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In returning from the Jacaré we entered the woods and
proceeded to the bank of the Rebeira Fazendinha, where
we breakfasted upon passorca and oranges in true traveller’s
style. As the components were simple, and yet readily
intermixed so as to give them a peculiar fitness for travelling,
the process should be understood. Boiled beef is cut
up into mincemeat, and then mixed with the farina made
of corn so intimately in a mortar that it becomes a coarse
powder, and is called passorca. This, then, is eaten with a
spoon, and, when combined with an orange, as in our repast,
it is really most excellent. In the absence of oranges
or a bottle of claret it is well to have water to drink while
it is eaten.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time Senor Francisco shot a macucu and her
young bird, which were regarded as a great acquisition to
assist in making out our breakfast next morning. This
bird of the forest is something larger than a chicken, and
is pronounced one of the best for the table; but, in the
present case, with young birds of the size of a partridge,
the hen is not in the best eating order. A small cobra was
also killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our ride, after leaving these woods, was principally
through campo lands, in some of which, large, high grass
was seen, but, for the most part, the growth of grass was
small and scattering. In one place I observed small cane
had been growing and was burned off, so that a new crop was
sprouting up over the ground. This would doubtless be
good grazing while it is tender.</p>

<p class='c007'>We saw several considerable droves of cattle that were
in fair condition, and the calves generally presented a good
appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woodland which was passed in the midst of the campo
lands was very well timbered, and looked as if it might
have strength of soil adapted to the production of cotton.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The sand, however, predominated largely in most of it that
was seen; and Senor Joaquim Lorenço told us this was a
fair type of these lands located in other parts of the territory.
With this information, it was not thought advisable
to make a tour of fifteen or twenty miles to see a duplicate
of that which we examined; and it was concluded that we
would repair to the situ on the place for the night. We
passed a fine stream of water some mile of two from the
houses, and found a small water-course at the place, adapted
to work a monjolo, and perhaps it would serve for a small
grist-mill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon arriving at the situ, we found that our camarada
and cook had every thing in progress for dinner, and we
were soon served with a good, warm, substantial repast,
which seemed to be appreciated by all, after the long and
tiresome day’s ride, through campos, in the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dining, Colonel Joaquim Lorenço, at our request,
sketched upon the ground the outline of this extensive collection
of lands, and its relations to other adjoining places,
giving a rough map of all the tracts of land convenient to
the villa of Araraquara which it was supposed would be
sold. Upon this, Mr. Street based a plan and sketched the
outlines for a map, which he proposed to fill out in examining
the surrounding country, and it is likely to be very useful.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Getting an extra early breakfast, we set out this morning,
and rode through a wide extent of rather indifferent
land, diversified by hill and dale, as well as broad-extended
plains. There were some portions of woodland, having a
light soil, in which the sandy element prevailed to an extent
that must render it of small value. But there were other
portions of woodland, with a reddish-colored soil, which
were evidently of a better quality. Yet none had the dark purple
hue which characterizes the terra rocha soil, and
which is regarded the best quality of land in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>In passing through the fazenda of Monte Allegre, immense
undulating plains of red soil were traversed; and
different views were entertained as to the practicability of
cultivating these lands successfully with the plough. There
is in many places almost no vegetation, and the dry, hard,
red earth looks as if it scarcely had the requisite elements
for the germination and sustentation of grass or plants of
any kind. This may depend in part upon the long-protracted
drought which has existed in all this region of country;
yet it is an inexplicable circumstance that no planter
attempts to raise a crop upon any portion of these campos,
and their cultivation would certainly be attended with less
labor than clearing up matto lands. An experiment with
the plough should, however, be made, with a view to test
their productiveness.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we reached the situ of Senor José Pinto, in charge
of this fazenda, every thing was found ready for our comfort,
as he had been notified of our coming by Senor Joaquim
Lorenço. Being in advance, with some others who did not
speak Portuguese, it devolved upon me to use my small
stock in communicating with the proprietor, and I am encouraged
to find that my words are understood, while I
comprehend much that is said by others in this tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dinner was served in accordance with the most approved
style of the country, the courses being of great variety, and
the plates being frequently changed. We were agreeably
surprised with the excellent taste displayed in connection
with the table, and it was no less a matter of admiration to
find beds arranged for all our large party with the greatest
elegance. The pillow-cases were decorated with fine lace,
and some of the spreads were beautifully embroidered. It
is an odd fancy with many families to have towels of very
fine material trimmed with very broad lace, and this was
exhibited here in the greatest profusion upon the towels for
our use.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a water-course on each side of the houses, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>uniting below, form a considerable stream. This large creek
has a fall upon it, which affords a very favorable site for
machinery, and indeed each of the smaller streams is also
adapted to supply good water-power, while one of them
already has a cotton-gin and grist-mill in operation, but
both on a small scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an enclosure near the mill-house there are two large
trees, called Ximbo, which we were told had been planted
there some years ago; and this would seem to indicate that
the land will grow other trees better than those usually seen
in campos. These trees present a luxuriant, thriving aspect,
and afford a very fine shade for stock, while they would be
highly decorative and useful in the immediate vicinity of the
dwelling. It is remarked, however, that shade trees are
seldom seen here about a house, and the climate being very
warm during most of the year, the benefit of the trees ought
to be apparent to all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orange trees are growing in the garden attached to this
house, and though not bearing at present, they are well
developed and will doubtless yield abundantly in proper
season. The oranges in all this region are said to be very
fine, and in some places the trees are found still with some
fruit, which is of the very best quality. It has been a matter
of consideration with me, whether the growing of the orange
for the purpose of making wine and brandy might not become
profitable. That a good article of each can be produced
has already been satisfactorily proved, and there is a
modification of the wine, known by the name of Coracão,
which is very much prized. This name implies that it is
adapted to cheer the heart, and it is considered a great delicacy.
I have tasted a specimen of the ordinary wine of
the orange, and thought it corresponded very much to the
Sherry wine, which is certainly one of the best wines that is
imported to the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>A dog-kennel with seventeen deer-hounds was seen here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and these animals have sharp ears like the wolf, with greater
activity and fleetness than our hounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>At five o’clock this morning three of the party and myself
joined the proprietor in making a tour of observation
in the plantation and neighboring woodlands of Monte
Allegre. The soil was not of a superior quality, yet it
would doubtless produce moderately well. Cotton had been
planted last year, and seemed to have made an average
stalk, while that more recently planted was growing quite
as well as the want of cultivation would warrant. The large
proportion of unproductive land upon this fazenda, and the
medium quality of most of the woodland, do not present encouraging
features for a settlement upon it. Yet the fine
location, and the water facilities, have evidently inspired
General Wood with the idea that it would afford a favorable
location for a city of newcomers. It is thought, moreover,
that in the event of the extension of a railroad to this region,
it will pass in the immediate vicinity of this place.
That the location is healthy is shown by the residence of a
large family and quite a gang of negroes for many years at
this site, with very slight sickness of any kind. But there
are wanting, in my view, the most essential requisites for
building a city, or for establishing a large number of our
people, in the deficient basis for agricultural pursuits and the
absence of means of transportation, while there is a very
scanty supply of timber at any point convenient for use.
We need many things in commencing a settlement for which
we must depend upon the resources of the surrounding
country, or upon transportation from other parts; and in
case these supplies are not likely to be found near at hand,
the means of ready communication with some furnishing
point becomes essential.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left Monte Allegre about 9 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, and came
out through a different portion of the territory from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>previously seen, but found no improvement in the nature of
the soil. At one point we were informed that a field of
coffee (cafézar) was near the road, but being of recent planting,
it would have afforded very little idea of the fitness of
the soil to its growth, and hence we did not visit it. The
woodlands passed through to-day belonged to that class
known as terra branca, having a large proportion of sand
mixed with the soil, and might perhaps be appropriate for
the cultivation of cotton for a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the lands of Monte Allegre, I proceeded
with Senor Joaquim Lorenço, and Mr. Snell as interpreter,
to examine some of the woodland belonging to the tract
known as Lageado. The growth upon it is of good size,
and much of it very suitable for building purposes. There
is a stream of water suited for domestic purposes running
lengthwise throughout the body of woods, and there is a
large water-course at one extremity, which is available for
machinery. This land is of a gray aspect, having a considerable
proportion of sand; yet Senor Joaquim thinks it will
grow every thing to advantage excepting coffee and sugar-cane.
He tells me also that there is a portion of red land
(terra vermilho) which would grow those articles in common
with others.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Accompanied by Senor Joaquim Lorenço, we moved at
daylight from his fazenda en route for Brotas and Jahu,
and without any incident of special moment, we stopped
about noon at the fazenda of Senor Jacinto Antonio Fagandes,
(deceased.) We were supplied with water, and also
with milk and water mixed, which spoiled both these articles,
and brought up associations that ought not to arise in connection
with the hospitality of our friends. We were furnished
with coffee also after waiting until our patience was
exhausted, but it was thankfully received and enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we saw the skin of an ant-eater, (Tamandoa Bandoera,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>which is of a gray color, with the hair upon the
back very harsh and long, and the tail of immense size,
spreading out like a fan at the sides. This animal has powerful
arms and front paws, with which it tears up the earth
in search of the nests of the ant; and it is said to be very
ferocious when encountered by other animals. An instance
has been communicated, in which an ant-eater and a tiger
became engaged, with the result of killing the former, yet
the claws had been so imbedded in the flesh of the tiger
that it remained clinging to it, until the sickening and
emaciation of the tiger made it an easy prey to the hunter,
when the dried body of the ant-eater was found still attached
by its claws to the body of the tiger.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is given as reported to me by a person who claimed
to have a personal knowledge of the fact, and illustrates the
tenacious grasp of this animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the dwelling, and its incumbent of milk
and water memory, we passed through a portion of the
land of this fazenda, which contains about eighteen thousand
acres, and is now for sale. There is a branch or small
creek with very clear water, which was crossed after entering
one of the fields. The soil here was evidently well suited
to the growth of corn, as there were large heaps lying in
the husk on each side of the road, preparatory to being
hauled and put into the crib or paijol. There were also a
number of young coffee trees growing in this field, but we had
no information as to their age, and it is sufficient to remark
that they looked vigorous and healthy, with a good prospect
for the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party to whose estate this place belongs owned three
large fazendas; and there is one located near Lemeira,
which is said to be a valuable coffee plantation, giving a
large annual yield.</p>

<p class='c007'>The place passed this morning is called Carrentes, and is
about two miles from the situ of Major Gaveão.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving these lands, we passed through a most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>dreary sand-bed of nearly two leagues in extent, and crossing
the Jacaré river at a water-fall, (Cachoeira,) we stopped
for the night at the residence of Senor José Rodrigues
Simães.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a very superior site for machinery, and yet the
main stream is not made available, while a small stream
entering into it is turned into a race through a large hollow
log, and moves quite a large sugar-mill and a monjolo.</p>

<p class='c007'>A trough was measured here with dimensions of forty by
forty-five inches. We were supplied with oranges and limes
in great abundance and of the finest quality. In the course
of the evening, I had stepped into the back part of the house
to ask a servant to bring me a basin of water; and shortly
afterwards the proprietor of the house, in company with my
old friend, Senor Joaquim, came to me with a candle in his
hand and said something about sickness, which I supposed
referred to myself. I told him in Portuguese, of course, as
neither of them understood any thing else, that nothing
ailed me, and that the water asked for was simply to wash
my hands and face.</p>

<p class='c007'>They looked at each other, and wearing quite an embarrassed
aspect, repeated the remark as to the sickness,
which, with my imperfect knowledge of the language, was
not properly understood, but was construed to mean, that
I had better go to a room and lie down. Again I remonstrated,
when the old Colonel gave me to understand that
it was not on my account, but for the relief of another, that
they desired me to go to the room. This placed the matter
upon quite a different basis, and I proceeded to examine a
man who had been seriously wounded on the head by the blow
of a cudgel, while engaged in an affray. He was then laboring
under oppression of the brain to some extent, and learning
that his bowels were torpid, I administered a dose of
calomel, with directions to follow it with oil, and to keep
cloths wet with cold water constantly to his head, which
should be placed near a window.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>I went out of the room, hoping but little for any benefit
from the treatment, and yet he was not in a state to bear
blood-letting. Our interpreter being absent from the house
caused the awkward interview as reported.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We were all roused before daylight, to make ready for
the road, and upon examining my patient I was gratified
to find that his medicine had been productive of good results,
with encouragement to hope for recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Getting a cup of coffee before starting, we took breakfast
at the house of Senor José Venancio Carneiro, and reached
Brotas at twelve o’clock. We found the population alive to
the importance of the visit, and an address of welcome was
made to General W. W. W. Wood by Dom Francisco Ernesto
Malheiros, to which the General responded. Mr. Bennaton
repeated the remarks of the former at the close of his address,
making &#38;c., &#38;c., &#38;c., cover a large gap in memory.
But he interpreted the words of the General as they were
delivered, giving each paragraph separately, as a pause was
made for that purpose. This part of the performance was
executed to the entire satisfaction of all concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>I delivered a letter to the above-named gentleman, and
also one to Senor Francisco de Campos of the place, each
of whom tendered any assistance that might be useful to me
or my friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was gratifying to find here among those who rode out
to meet us my friend Rev. A. L. Blackford; and upon leaving,
he rode out several miles with me, as an act of personal
kindness and courtesy, which was duly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>We dined in the villa of Brotas, at a house owned by the
same gentleman at whose residence we breakfasted, but he
was not present on either occasion, being at some distance
on business in the country. Being notified by Senor Joaquim,
the family arranged every thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>When our party were in readiness to start out of town in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the afternoon, there was quite a large concourse of gentlemen
on horseback presented themselves to accompany us
on our way; and the street was thronged on the side-walks
and in the windows with women and others, who seemed to
look upon our movement as something remarkable for this
quiet place.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Wood had received an invitation before reaching
the town, through a special messenger, to proceed to the
house of Senor Antonio Joaquim Camargo and spend the
night. It was also stated that several letters had been received
by this gentleman from persons in São Paulo, suggesting
that he should entertain this party; and hence the
General set aside a previous arrangement of the old Colonel,
that we would go to the house of his son-in-law, and went
with Senor Camargo, to enjoy his hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the special invitation of my old friend, I accompanied
him to the house of his son-in-law, Senor Domingos
José Carneiro, and found that all requisite preparations had
been made for entertaining the entire company. Dinner
had been in progress, and all the bedding was in readiness
to make all comfortable for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>This residence is upon the elevated plateau of the serra,
and we had a very steep ascent to make in reaching the
crest, but once gained, the view of the country for miles up
and down the valley, or rather the lower strata of land, was
really magnificent. The soil here is excellent, and all the
staples are growing well. Coffee seems to flourish particularly
well, though not in terra rocha.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Saturday</span>, <i>November 4, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>My old friend, the Colonel, rose at half-past three o’clock
this morning, and directed our horses to be fed and coffee
to be prepared for us, preliminary to early starting.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was forcibly reminded last night of the difference between
the lady of the house and our ladies, by her remaining
in the room while we were preparing to retire to bed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Though tired and sleepy, I waited some time after taking
off my coat and vest, before she took the hint to leave, and
after I got in bed, she came back to talk to her father, who
then had off his wearing apparel, and was sitting on the
side of the bed. This is mentioned simply to illustrate the
want of sensitiveness on the part of women in the ordinary
respectable class of society in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Joaquim Lorenço and I left about half-past four
o’clock, with a negro to put us on the right road after getting
out of the plantation. Upon reaching the fazenda of
Senor Camargo, we learned that the General and his party
had left some half hour previous. The road travelled by
them was marked by the tracks of their animals, and, besides,
a green bough of a tree had been placed in the roads
that were not to be taken, and we consequently followed
them without difficulty. Most persons place a bough on the
road to be taken; but, knowing that Mr. Bennaton pursued
the other course, I understood this thing, which was likely
to puzzle the old Colonel, when he perceived the bush on
one road and the tracks leading another route.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming up with the pack-train, we found that a camarada
was ascending a tree upon which grew a large crop of very
fine jaboticabas, and availed ourselves of as many as
we could eat. We took, moreover, quite a supply of this
delicious fruit in a handkerchief, thinking it would be very
acceptable to our friends ahead; but it so turned out that
I carried the rather weighty package eight miles before
overtaking the party. They had halted at about eleven
o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, for breakfast, at the fazenda of Senor Joaquim
Oliveiro Mattozenia; but, as there was no notice of their coming,
it was likely to be some time before any thing to eat
could be in readiness. It was, therefore, most acceptable to all,
that the Colonel had brought an assortment of substantials,
with the expectation of eating on the roadside; and they
promptly availed themselves of the chickens, pork, rice,
farina, &#38;c., which was spread out before them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Notwithstanding the flourish-of-trumpets with which
Senor Antonio Joaquim Camargo had announced his readiness
to accommodate General Wood and party, they found
quite a deficiency of the comforts which had been met elsewhere;
and, going to bed on a very light repast, they were
now as hungry as half-starved wolves. In a short time
after this cold lunch was concluded, it was announced that
a hot breakfast was ready in the dining-room, and we found
the table laden with good things, of which none could partake
very largely after the previous supply; yet all went through
the form of eating, so as not to give offence to the lady of
the house, who, in the absence of her husband, had manifested
so much cheerfulness in preparing this breakfast.
Senor Camargo had accompanied the party thus far, but
declined to partake of the lunch, and must have felt chagrined
to note the greater providence exhibited in this
matter than had been observed by him in starting them
out without breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been a considerable hubbub among our party
the previous day, in reference to departing from the prearranged
plan of Senor Joaquim Lorenço, that all should go
to the house of his son-in-law, Senor Domingos; and in
going to the fazenda of Senor Antonio Joaquim Camargo
the highest expectations were indulged as to the immense
preparations that had been made for a grand reception and
sumptuous entertainment. When it turned out so differently
from what was anticipated, all vowed that, henceforth, the
party would stick to the old Colonel, and abide by whatever
he might plan for them in future movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our course to-day lay through fair lands for the greater
portion of the route, and the place at which we stopped
yields cane of the finest quality, having seen four huge oxcart
loads moving from the fields to the sugar-house. This
establishment has a large overshot water-wheel, and three
iron cylinders for the expressing of the juice of the cane.
The appliances for treating the sugar were few in number,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and not apparently well adapted to the object; yet the
specimen of sugar at breakfast was very fine, and was of
domestic manufacture.</p>

<p class='c007'>As stated above, the proprietor, Senor Joaquim Oliveiro
Mattozenia, was not at home; but we met him on the way,
after leaving his house, and he returned with us to the
Freguezia de Jahu. He took us there to a house in which
his business is done, and sent out for ale to supply the
whole thirsty multitude, while coffee was prepared for those
of us who preferred to take it. He then went with us to
the fazenda of Dom José Correa Leite de Moraes, about two
miles from the village, where we were expected by prior
arrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host is a practising physician and has his drugs in
the reception room, upon shelves occupying each side of an
angle, and making evidently a good assortment of medicines,
adapted to almost every use in the treatment of diseases.
Although the labels were mostly in Portuguese, I
readily understood them from the similarity to the technicals
in Latin. Since finding the embarrassment of prescribing
for those who do not understand a Latin formula,
it has impressed me forcibly that this technical language
that is recognized by most nations ought to be adopted by
all, so as to simplify the filling of prescriptions by physicians
of different countries wherever their services may be
in requisition over the whole world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soil in this immediate vicinity is a very dark purple
or brown color, and is generally called here black land,
(terra preta or terra masape.) It is very rich in those elements
requisite for production, and yields all kinds of crops
with but little labor. The consistence is such that, when
wet, it adheres with great tenacity to the shoes, and hence
the term “masape.” It corresponds in many respects to
the rich bottom lands lying upon the Mississippi river, and
is not inferior to the best soil of that region for sugar-cane,
cotton, or corn. As yet the culture of coffee has not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>introduced for a length of time to test its qualities for that
crop, but it is confidently expected to yield well.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some places there are numerous small fragments of clear
rock crystal mixed up with this dark soil, which shine
brightly by the contrast, and cause one to think there may
be diamonds in the same region. I believe, however, that
jewels and minerals of much value are confined to sterile
lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>This being the thirteenth anniversary of my marriage-day,
it is recalled with many reflections as to the present wide
separation from her who is united with me in the holy bonds
of matrimony. The day and hour and attendant circumstances
of our union have all been vividly brought to mind;
and the many scenes of enjoyment, with some of sadness,
which have marked our course in life, have caused emotions
within my breast which those around knew nothing of,
and which were not in unison with the stir and excitement
of the past day.</p>

<p class='c007'>We commenced this series of thirteen years in the full
enjoyment of mutual affection, yet we did not and could not
know each other’s heart and devotion as we have learned them
by many repeated acts of self-sacrifice on the part of each for
the other. No one, without the experience of that love
which exists alone between husband and wife, can realize
how entirely self may be absorbed in the devotion of the
soul to the welfare and enjoyment of one another. If
there was a joy or a sweet allowed me in this life which
could not be shared by my wife, it would detract from the
gratification I would have from it; and I know too well
that every happiness which can be extended to me by my
true-hearted and loving wife affords an increase of happiness
to her. We have shared many trials together, and
have become the parents of seven children; one of whom
left us for a place among the angels of heaven, at the early
age of eight months, while four interesting daughters and
two sons of promising parts remain to cheer us still.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>How pleasant and precious is the thought of again returning
to enjoy the associations of my beloved wife and
my darling children. There is no sentiment of the human
heart that is more elevating and refining in its tendency
than the love which a husband feels for his wife, and the
affection he has welling up in his breast for his children.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In its silence and beauty,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Its passion and power;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love breathed o’er the land</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like the soul of a flower.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the heart of him who has a sincere regard for his
family, love is truly as delicate and sensitive as the aroma
of the sweetest flower. It is the most tender and devoted
consecration of the soul to the interests and enjoyments of
those cherished objects. It is the confiding sincerity and
purity of faith which the affectionate husband and father
realizes for those that are bound to him by the most holy
and gentle ties of mutual love. It is not a hope, but a full
and complete enjoyment of reciprocal attachment. The
faith and trust are without a shadow of misgiving as to the
return they will meet, and the soul rests in blissful consciousness
of the love of wife and children.</p>

<p class='c007'>The light beaming forth in the full glare of a noon-day
sun may fail to convince me of the warmth of that brilliant
orb; but the glow of delight which brightens the eye
and lights up the features of my wife and my children when
we meet, cannot, must not, and will not, leave the shadow
of a doubt as to their affection for me. We live in the
sweet realization of each other’s love, and it is accompanied
by the most unselfish desire to promote the comfort and
enjoyment of each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>If I seek the good things of this life, it is that my family
may share them with me. If I seek exemption from the
cares and vexations of the world, it is to shield them from
annoyance. If I seek preferment among my fellowmen, it is
with the anxious thought that they may thus be brought into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>more desirable and honorable associations. If I seek social
enjoyment, the most exquisite gratification is found in the
interchange of cordial sentiments with my own loved ones
at home. All in all, it is with the anticipation of such
happiness in future days that I now seek a place of refuge
from the troubles of my native land.</p>

<p class='c007'>May God in his goodness and infinite mercy protect and
sustain my wife and my children, while I am endeavoring
to secure a home for them here, is the constant prayer of
my heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am now separated from all that is held dear in the
associations of life; and no step has ever been taken heretofore
which caused me so much anxiety and apprehension
for the welfare of my family as leaving them in the midst
of troubles and irregularities in society, such as the world
has never witnessed before. But having taken all the preliminary
steps which human forecast could suggest for the
comfort of those near and dear to me, and with the attention
of a kind friend, who would look after them and their
interests with the care of a brother, I trust in the providence
of a merciful God, that they may be preserved from all harm,
and that we may be soon returned to each other in health,
peace, and happiness.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This being the Sabbath, I announced my intention to
make it a day of rest, and the old Colonel said he would remain
with me, while the others purposed to take a ride of
fourteen miles to the Tieté river. A huge bag of provisions
was prepared for the expedition by our host, and a guide
was expected to meet them at the town of Jahu. But notwithstanding
all these preliminary arrangements, the trip
was abandoned, and all remained quietly at the house of
Dom José Correa Leite de Moraes for the day. He is a
cousin of the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several gentlemen came to visit us from the surrounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>country, and dined with us. Among them was a Catholic
priest, Senor Francisco Ferreira Garcia, the vicar of this
district, and Senor Lorenço de Arruda Prado, another
cousin of Colonel Joaquim.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former had the misfortune to be thrown from his
mule after bidding some of our party good-by upon the
road, but was not injured. The latter appeared to be a very
clever gentleman, and is said to be a successful planter. In
being introduced to him by my old friend, the Colonel, I was
informed of his relationship, and on his leaving, I extended
the customary assistance in mounting his mule, which is regarded
here as a simple act of courtesy to a gentleman who
visits you. This act of attention is a part of that general
politeness which is observed among the best class of Brazilians,
and struck us, as it must every one not familiar
with the usages of the people, in the light of a menial service
that was not compatible with the relation of one gentleman
to another, yet custom makes it not only proper and
becoming, but almost obligatory. The party assisting
usually looses the horse, holds the bridle, and steadies the
stirrups while the other mounts, and the guest is expected
to avail himself of this assistance without regard to
the age or rank of the person tendering it, though in some
instances he may demur when he thinks circumstances
should preclude it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host is lively and intelligent, speaking French with
fluency, and having a little knowledge of the English.
Shortly after our arrival at his house, I made some remark
to him in Portuguese, which at first was not understood,
and he indicated his wish that it should be repeated, by the
usual word, “Como?” (How?) I used the same expression
again and was fully comprehended, and answered accordingly.
Immediately after this, General Wood’s interpreter,
Mr. Snell, who is an Englishman that has been a number of
years in Brazil, spoke to the Dom in Portuguese, and he,
taking this to be another American with a slim stock of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the language, did not comprehend what was said, and replied
to him, “Não entendo,” (I don’t understand.) This
gave us a good laugh upon Mr. Snell. In my use of the
language it was simply “Como?” but with him, who was
here as interpreter, the party addressed was compelled to
say “Não entendo,” taking him to be a novice in Portuguese.
The fact is, that while Mr. Snell understands the language
well, and speaks it fluently, he has a habit of cutting off the
last syllable of his words, that makes it somewhat difficult
at times to gather the full meaning of his remarks, and hence
this mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady of the house has evidently associated more with
gentlemen than most of those occupying a like position, and
hence appears more at ease in company, joining in general
conversation with those who speak the language. She departs
greatly from the habit of our ladies by suckling her child in
the presence of gentlemen. Though she was in the dining-room
during our meals, the crowded table was perhaps a
sufficient reason for not being seated with us, and she was
looking after the proper supply of articles by the servants,
though the Dom seemed to assume the chief responsibility
in this respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The culinary arrangements of this establishment, like most
others in Brazil, are under the same roof with the residence
of the family, and the fire is built upon the earthen floor in
the open room, without any other outlet for the smoke than
is afforded by the spaces between the tiles which cover the
house. As it was rather cool during the evenings, we took
a seat in a circle around this fire, and thus had a very
sociable <i>family circle</i>, which gives me the key to an explanation
of that term, which has never before been fully
understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host follows the course of his kinsman, Colonel Joaquim
Lorenço, in regard to the abundance of supplies upon
his table at all three meals, and supper is quite equal to
breakfast in the variety of the articles. I tell them that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>they give us three dinners every day, and if we were to remain
stationary, all would be foundered in a short time, or
take the gout, though I do not hear of this affection in the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had for supper, this evening, a portion of the large
fish called the Jahu, from which the river and town derived
their names. It is a huge fish similar to our catfish, though
the head is not so broad in proportion to its size, and the
meat tastes more like that of scale fish. All relished it
very much; and, though we had fared so well at breakfast
and dinner, the Jahu tempted us to eat heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had an opportunity of examining, to-day, one of the
large lizards of this country, called “lagarto,” and there
is nothing to which it can be better compared than a young
alligator of two and a half feet in length. The resemblance
in its conformation to one of our small, gray lizards is almost
perfect, and the flesh is said to be very fine, but its appearance
is too suggestive of the class of reptiles for my taste.
This specimen was caught by a servant, and brought into
the house, for our inspection, while still alive. Many of
them have been seen in the woods during our tour, and they
are said to be inimical to the poisonous cobra, engaging and
killing the snake whenever it is encountered. The large
number of these lagartos, and the few cobras, that are found
in our exploration of the forest, would favor the idea that
the former have established the mastery. In this view, the
lagarto should be preserved from injury, and, most assuredly,
something more inviting can be found for food.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lagarto has a forked tongue like a serpent, and thrusts
it out in the same manner when disturbed. It is stated,
also, that during the winter months, though there be no
frost, they live in a state of torpidity after the mode of reptiles.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In accordance with previous arrangements, we were all
supplied with fresh animals by the fazendeiros of the neighborhood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>and set out for Sapé and the river Tieté. Reaching
the fazenda of Senor Paulo Lima about eight o’clock,
after a ride of twelve miles, we found that he expected us
to stop and take breakfast. Though his house and the surroundings
did not present a very promising aspect, yet we
found, in due course of time, a most excellent meal was
served to us, and all were highly pleased with the plain
courtesy of our host.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands lying between the Freguezia de Jahu and this
point are located upon either side of the river Jahu, and
rather irregular in general conformation. They are, for the
most part, of a deep red color and of firm consistence, with
more or less of the fudra de ferro, constituting the best
quality of terra rocha. The Figeré Branca and the Pon
d’Alho are conspicuous in most parts of this territory, and
indicate the fertility of the soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout this region, which includes a number of old
settlements, and others of more recent date, much of
the matto virgem (original forest) has been cleared off,
and open fields of large extent are either in cultivation or
in pasture for the use of horses and cattle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rio Jahu pursues a very tortuous course, with frequent
falls or rapids, and offers advantageous situations for
machinery at various points. It runs into the river Tieté
about sixteen miles from the town of the same name, Jahu;
and the lands on each side of it, throughout this extent, are
of the best quality; yet the steep hills and rather mountainous
elevations of the precincts unfit some of the lands
for proper cultivation. These high and irregular portions
of ground would be very appropriate for coffee, as the hillsides
and elevated lands are usually selected for this crop;
while the low flat lands in this section are liable to some
frost in the cold season.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am informed that the quality of the soil is equally good
to the distance of three leagues, or twelve miles, on the
north side of the Rio Jahu, and to the distance of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>leagues, or eight miles, on the south side. In this extensive
area there are a few small patches of less valuable land, but
in the main, it will be found that the soil is of the deep red
color, or of the dark brown order, and lying in many parts
very advantageously for cultivation.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfasting we set out again, and passing the obscure
capella of Sapé, we travelled sixteen miles to the
fazenda of Senor Louiz Pereira Barbose, where we were
expected by previous notice from our friend the old Colonel.
Though the house was small, and the resources for accommodating
so large a number rather limited, yet he manifested
a disposition to do all in his power for the comfort of
the party.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rode over a comparatively level region in coming from
the house of Senor Lima to this place, and though not giving
evidence of so much fertility as that near the Rio Jahu,
it is generally of good quality, and is well supplied with
water for ordinary domestic purposes. There was no portion
of useless land seen upon this route, and no campos
have been encountered since leaving the town of Brotas.
The timber throughout this plateau is of good size, and
much of it very favorable for splitting to make fences, as
the quarenta, which grows especially abundant near the
fazenda at which we are stopped. This tree is very durable
when made into rails, and has its name from the impression
that it lasts during forty years. In entering the
premises, I observed the neatest and most substantial fencing
yet seen in Brazil, and was informed that the rails are
of this material. One end of the rails is embedded in the
earth, and they are arranged side by side in a perpendicular
form, with a cross-bar of the palmetto running horizontally
about two feet from the top, which is secured by being
lashed continuously with the sipo vine. This sipo is a long
and slender vine of surprising strength and flexibility, which
is used for confining the rafters of houses, tying timbers
together where pegs or nails would be used with us, baling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>cotton, and, indeed, for any purpose to which ropes might
be applied. It is called in common parlance the Brazilian
nail, and it is remarkable to what an extent it is made a
substitute for nails.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is particularly well suited for constructing these stake-fences,
and no better enclosure can be devised for the protection
of a crop against large or small intruders.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Wood, Doctor Warne, and Mr. Snell parted from
the rest of us at the house of Senor Lima, and went down
to the mouth of the Jahu, and descended the river Tieté in
canoes for two miles. They gave a favorable account of
the general outline of the banks on each side, but found
the channel of the river so shallow in several places that
the canoes came in contact with the bottom, and it was
requisite for the boatmen to draw them over by getting
out into the water. There was one point at which there
were rapids or falls, and they got out upon the shore, while
those in charge of the canoes carried them over the fall,
receiving them again below into the canoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This being a drought of many months continuance, the
river is said to be lower than it has been before for twelve
years, and the ordinary level of the water is stated to be
six feet above its present state. It is thought by persons
acquainted with the river, that there is sufficient water
during the rainy months, to afford a passage for flat-bottomed
propellers to Perecicaba, from which point there is a
wagon-road to Campinas, and from thence the railroad will
perhaps be available in a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the account received, and from my personal inspection
of the river, I think there is but little prospect of navigating
it with safety, and unless there be a practicable route
for a railway to this region of country, its products must
depend on transportation by pack-mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>The elevated serra near Brotas is perhaps the most
serious obstacle to a railroad, and it remains for engineers
to determine whether this can be overcome.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>If a line of railroad is extended to Araraquara, and can
communicate with the Rio Jaceré below Cambury, then
this section of country lying between the Tieté and Jaceré
might avail itself of the Jaceré for navigation up to that
point, and thus get an outlet for its products.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Jaceré is represented to have a deep and open channel
from its mouth up to Cambury; and all the rich region
lying between it and the Tieté and extending along the
Jahu would be better accommodated by effecting this
result than to attempt to navigate the Tieté upwards.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Having but a limited number of beds, our host provided
some dried raw-hides which were spread upon the dirt
floor, and about one-half of our party slept upon them,
with their overcoats, &#38;c., assisting to fill out the scanty
supply of bedding. There was no particular inconvenience
experienced except from the fleas, which found ready access
to our friends upon the hides and interrupted somewhat the
quietness of their repose. Mr. Snell and myself were
perched upon a long high table, and being thus above the
jumping height of a flea we fared very well. I have carried
a blanket and pillow throughout my trip, and found
them with my overcoat very convenient on this occasion.
A bed had been assigned to me, but feeling that our good
friend Senor Joaquim Lorenço should of all others be provided
for, I persuaded him to occupy the bed, and I slept
comfortably upon the table during the whole night.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the good spirit exhibited by our host we all tried
to be satisfied, and though it was quite different from the
comforts received at other places, he evidently did the best
which his resources would allow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meals were abundant and well prepared, with another
large Jahu fish to grace the table. As I had brought along
some tomato catsup, it was drawn forth on this occasion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>give a zest to the fine fish, and the entire bottle was consumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this, I have transported likewise from
the outset, four cans of tomatoes, two cans of mutton, and
one can of partridge, thinking that we would find ourselves
in some situation where the necessaries of life could not be
obtained; yet we have had no occasion to use them, and
will not perhaps have need for them anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>After an early breakfast, I set out with Dr. Warne, Dr.
Wissen, Messrs. Brown and Kernan, accompanied by Senor
José Rebeiro Camargo, as our escort and guide, to visit a
portion of the lands lying between us and the Rio Jaceré.
This river was stated to be about sixteen miles distant, and
thinking it would be impracticable to make the trip to the
river, and return, I proposed to make a circuit, so as to return
by a different route from that upon which we went out.
Passing some grounds under cultivation shortly after starting,
the corn and beans with sweet potatoes gave fine
promise of the coming crop, and the lands in this vicinity
are evidently of good quality; but after passing some
miles farther, there was an inferior grade of soil with occasional
indications of barrenness.</p>

<p class='c007'>We made a halt at the house of Senor Ignacio Borgia
Pedrosa, where wine and coffee were served. Some large
oxen in the front of the house showed that the grass had
nutritious properties, while some mares and colts running
at large presented a good appearance. Subsequent to this
our escort took us to the residence of Senor Candido Pereira
Barbosa, but as he was absent, and we did not wish
to wait for dinner, we accepted the tender of coffee, and
made a lunch of sardines and cheese which had been
brought to meet our necessities. Upon riding into the
fields we saw some young coffee trees growing from the
seed. They were two years old and looked flourishing;
but with great diversity in size, resulting probably from a
deficient stand when first planted, and requiring to be replanted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>No estimate could be made as to the result in
maturing of the coffee trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands here were of a reddish aspect, with a considerable
portion of sand, and presented a favorable appearance
under cultivation; but the soil is not equal to that of the
lands adjacent to the Rio Jahu; nor were any of the lands
seen upon our route of the first order. For the most
part the surface was gently undulating, and this general
tableau was supplied with a variety of excellent timber,
among which the quarenta was observed to grow of full
size, and abundantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The supply of water was confined to small branches or
runs, that might be made available for a monjolo, or perhaps
for a small grist-mill, but not adapted to machinery
on a large scale. The largest stream traversing this section
of country was stated to lie somewhat beyond the line of
our route, and this may present more favorable conditions
for water-power. So far as my personal observation goes,
the Rio Jahu is the only reliance for the location of machinery
anywhere convenient to this territory.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had quite an adventure in the attempt of Senor Camargo
to ascend a tree to gather some jaboticabas for us,
and it had well nigh proved a serious matter. The body
of the tree having no limbs for some distance up, he climbed
as far as his strength would permit, and being unable to
reach the limbs, or even to sustain himself in his grasp
upon the smooth surface of the tree, he let loose and slided
down most precipitately. He then secured a pole to the
side of the tree with sipo, and going to the top of it had
another handed up to him, which was secured above in like
manner, and thus he succeeded in getting us a delicious
bait of the fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>We returned by way of Sapé, which, though it has a few
small houses in close proximity, should not be recognized
as entitled to a name. In going up we passed this place
without giving it a special notice; and some of the party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>were not apprised that any place claiming a name had been
passed. It is simply a collection of some half dozen dirty
hovels, and yet has a shop, at which a thirsty gentleman
in our party found he could get a drink of cachaça, and
stopped us to look at him go through with the performance.
The patron saint of this humble refectory was a
corpulent Frenchman, who had recently bought a considerable
tract of land in the neighborhood, and was holding it
upon speculation. He doubtless thought a good time was
coming, when he was informed of our object in visiting this
section, and declined to sell even at an advance of two millreas
an alqueric, or sixteen and two-thirds cents per acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the most remote point of our trip to-day land was
valued at forty cents per acre; while here, at Sapé, it is
estimated at eighty cents per acre; and between this point
and Senor Lima’s one hundred dollars per acre is the price
affixed. In the vicinity of Jahu two hundred dollars an acre
was the valuation put upon a tract of land, which was equal
to any in the country, and thus the standard prices of this
section may be considered as fairly stated above, upon the
authority of landowners.</p>

<p class='c007'>We returned to our rendezvous a while before night, and
found the rest of the company had not stirred beyond the
premises during the day; and some of them were perched
upon some timber for machinery that lay in the yard, while
others met us, while relaxing their limbs in a short walk
from the house toward the outer gate of the enclosure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>We left the fazenda of Senor Louiz Pereira Barbose at 6
o’clock this morning, after partaking of an early breakfast,
and returned to the house of our old friend Senor Lima.
Here he had collected his breeding stock for our observation;
and though the mares were generally of small size,
there were a few very good young horses, and the colts for
the most part looked well. It is a little remarkable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>observe how entirely quiet the stallions are, when allowed
to run at large in this way with a promiscuous drove of
animals. There was a jackass also running with the stock,
yet I saw no young mules; and the dull and lifeless aspect
of this animal gave no promise of an increase of his stock.
There were thirty mares, and if even this number were
employed in rearing mules, it would doubtless prove profitable;
but this scrubby specimen of horses, which are propagated,
are not likely to give much return for the trouble
of looking after them. These animals subsist entirely upon
grass, and very rarely get salt, as it is too costly at these
interior places to be afforded for stock, except in very small
quantities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dining with Senor Lima we proceeded afterward upon
the same route by which we had gone up, and reached the
residence of Senor Dom Correa Leite de Moraes at four
o’clock in the afternoon. He and his wife received us
again most hospitably, and have extended all the kindness
possible to our whole party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our saddle-mules have remained here in his pasture, and
been fed with corn daily from his crib, while our clothing
has been washed and ironed in our absence. The pack-mules
have been sent off this afternoon so as to keep ahead
to-morrow.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Our cheerful and hospitable friend, Dom José Correa Leite
de Moraes, and his kind lady, received our cordial acknowledgments
at leaving them this morning. Our own mules
being fresh, moved off with alacrity, and upon reaching the
Freguezia de Jahu, we were met by Senor José Rebeiro
Camargo, and invited to the house of his son-in-law, where
wine and coffee were served, and his wife and daughter
came out to bid us adieu. It was thought that this demonstration
was in part for the purpose of showing his unmarried
daughter to one of the young men, to whom the father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>had taken a fancy for a son-in-law. But I doubt if the impression
was well calculated to promote his wishes for incorporating
an American graft into his family. This young
man was furnished with a list of the entire family, and
received a very cordial embrace from the father at parting.</p>

<p class='c007'>We breakfasted at the fazenda of Senor Joaquim Oliveiro
Mattozinto, and found him this time awaiting our arrival,
with every thing in readiness for giving us a substantial
entertainment. He had very kindly furnished mules for
some of our party during the recent trip, and had accompanied
us in person until sickness made it necessary for
him to return.</p>

<p class='c007'>The land from Jahu to this fazenda is of superior quality,
being of the dark brown order, and as this is eight miles
from the Rio Jahu, it may be inferred that this fine soil extends
to a like distance from the river elsewhere on this
side, which corresponds to the statement made in regard to
the breadth of good land extending along this stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general health of this region of country is very good,
yet there are cases of chill and fever reported upon the
Tieté and Jaceré, and throughout the region lying adjacent
to those water-courses. No instance was brought to my
knowledge of malarial disease remote from these streams;
and, from the general aspects of the country, I would not
think it likely to prevail to any considerable extent away
from their margins.</p>

<p class='c007'>I saw but two instances of goitre or bronchocele in this
entire region of country, and the information received from
Dom Correa is conclusively that they were not generated
here, but imported from other parts. There is no serra
here, and so far as my observation goes, goitre is confined
to those living in the vicinity of the serras.</p>

<p class='c007'>This section and the country about Araraquara are the
only parts visited thus far in which this ugly deformity did
not prevail amongst the women.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not however confined to the women exclusively, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>several instances have been seen among males, and the
condition of climate, water, atmosphere, or diet, which promotes
the development of this condition, cannot be favorable
to the constitutional health of those exposed to its
influence. No leprosy found here.</p>

<p class='c007'>We halted at a small shop upon our route to-day, where
oranges were sold at the rate of four for a cent; and all of
us having a relish for this fruit, concluded we never could
satisfy our taste more cheaply, so we turned to and ate the
whole stock in trade. One gentleman was reported to have
eaten fourteen oranges, but I thought that a full complement
was received with half of that number, and it puzzled
me to know how any one eat more than I did in the same
length of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large concourse of persons on horseback were met to-day,
males and females, dressed out in their best clothes.
Some of them were provided with musical instruments, and
there was a train of pack-mules, upon one of which there
were two immense boxes, and sundry smaller trunks upon
the others. We understood that it was a movement to celebrate
the feast of the Holy Ghost at the Freguezia de
Jahu, which is done yearly by the Catholics here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning by a different route from that of our trip in
going up, we encountered extensive campos, and soil generally
of inferior quality, until we reached the Serra de
Brotas, upon which the land, as stated previously, is very
good, and lies favorably.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached the residence of Senor Domingos José Carneiro
(son-in-law of the old Colonel) this afternoon at 5
o’clock, when we were kindly received by him and his wife,
and found every thing arranged for the comfort of the entire
party.</p>

<p class='c007'>A letter was received this afternoon from our faithful
friend, Senor Joaquim Lorenço, responding in the most
feeling terms to a communication made to him by our entire
party in leaving his house. As the two letters may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>be now inserted together, and may give those who read
these pages an idea of the relations subsisting with this
noble-souled Brazilian, I will give a translation of his in

<p class='c006'>My personal relations to this gentleman inspired a sort
of parental regard for him, which makes me cherish this
kind memento more perhaps than others of the company,
and I have therefore preserved the original, as a souvenir
of his friendship and generosity. We all desired to have a
likeness of our good friend, by which we might be constantly
reminded of that genial expression which springs
from his pure heart; but the photographists in this section
are very poorly provided with materials, and could not take
the impression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The high appreciation which all of us have for the character
of Senor Joaquim Lorenço is only in keeping with the
estimate in which he is held by all with whom we have conversed,
in the vicinity of Araraquara; and he is, with one
accord, regarded as the leading spirit of all that country.
His title of Lieutenant-Colonel is by virtue of his position
as commandant of the national guard of the district, and
from his admirable management for our tour, I should expect
him to conduct a campaign very successfully. All was
done quietly by him, and in his discipline upon his premises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>no loud word or confusion ever occurred, but every thing
progressed with great regularity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the house of our kind host, Senor Domingos
José Carneiro, we descended the Serra de Brotas by a most
precipitous route, differing from that of our ascent, which
was very steep, in being likewise very rugged and narrow.
It was not desirable to remain upon our mules in making
this passage down a steep, irregular, and rocky road, so that
all but one of the party dismounted, and lead our animals.
The father of our host, Senor José Venancio Carneiro, having
spent the night with us, they both accompanied us this
morning, and upon arriving at the villa of Brotas we found
that the elder gentleman had arranged for us to take refreshments
at his house, where we had dined in passing through.
The table was provided with very fine canned peaches and
other fruits, while wine and coffee were also served, thus
tempting us to eat, though we had so recently taken a hearty
breakfast where we spent the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>How we parted finally with our true-hearted friend, Senor
Joaquim Lorenço Correa, which was quite a touching scene,
in the manifestation of deep feeling with him and with all
of us.</p>

<p class='c007'>In company with Senor Domingos we proceeded sixteen
miles, for the most part through a dreary campo, to the fazenda
of Senor Francisco Antonio Macede, who is a son-in-law
of Senor José Venancio, and by whom we were joined
at this place in the course of the evening after our arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coffee was growing here in great luxuriance, and one
single tree was pointed out to us which yielded over one
arroba (which is thirty-two pounds) at a single crop. The
trees were unusually large, and hence had the appearance
of being too crowded in most parts of the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several patients were prescribed for at this place, and I
was impressed with the ingenuity displayed in a truss of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>domestic manufacture, which was worn by a negro man, laboring
under hernia. Of course, no charge was made for
advice anywhere, while enjoying the generous hospitalities
of the people, though they frequently asked for my bill, when
services were rendered, as at this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was oppressively hot during the latter part of
our ride to-day, and this was followed by a shower of rain
just as we arrived, but it was slight, scarcely laying the
dust. The country is suffering from need of rain, and that
topic, which ordinarily is regarded commonplace, becomes
now one of great interest to travellers as well as planters.
While we find the dust from a large number of animals occasionally
troublesome, the heat is of course more intense
when the earth is dry and parched than it would be if some
evaporation was taking place from a damp surface. Still,
however, we do not find travelling in the heat of the day
attended with greater inconvenience than during the summer
in the Southern States, and we are now approaching
the hottest season of this latitude. It would be preferable
for those exploring this country to travel early in the morning
and late in the evening, and the arrangement of hours
for breakfast and dinner could be made so as to lie by during
the entire hot portion of each day, with greater comfort
to man and beast.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sumptuous lunch, brought by Senor Domingos, was
eaten with oranges, upon stopping to-day, and was followed
by coffee furnished at this place. It will be seen that these
people know how to provide for the inner man. A dinner
of most ample proportions was served at six o’clock, and all
had to rally their appetites again.</p>

<p class='c007'>After taking breakfast at an earlier hour than usual, we
left the fazenda of Senor Francisco, accompanied by him
and his father-in-law, Senor José Venancio.</p>

<p class='c007'>This old gentleman seems determined to make amends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>for his absence from home when we first visited his house;
and, in response to a letter of introduction which I delivered
to him, he said that he stood ready to aid us in any way
we might command his services. He said that in the event
our people should conclude upon coming anywhere in this
region of country, to give him notice, and transportation
would be provided free of cost to as many as he could find
mules to accommodate, either of his own or other parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>My attention was attracted this morning by the peculiar
yelping of a large bird of the ostrich order, which I endeavored
to get a sight of, but being very shy, it ran away and
was concealed in the thick shrubbery of the campo.</p>

<p class='c007'>We passed the small stream Rio Onca (tiger river) and
the large and clear water-course Rio Lobos (wolf river),
where a small piece of matto virgem (original forest) of good
quality was entered, which was the only relief to the extended
campos, until we approached near to the fazenda of
Senor Joaquim Firmino de Oliveiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we stopped, and were regaled with an ample supply
of jaboticabas, that fruit which, once eaten, no one can ever
fail to enjoy. Having dined in a very substantial way with
this gentleman, some of the party concluded to remain there
with General Wood for the night; while I came with others
to the city of Rio Claro, in the midst of a considerable fall
of rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped at the house of Dr. J. H. Gattiker, a Swiss
physician, and in his absence were courteously received and
entertained by his dignified and yet affable lady.</p>

style, the beds were especially neat, having damask covers
lined with silk, and the pillow-cases trimmed with fringe of
the most tasteful pattern. The towels were also of fine material,
and each end trimmed with fringe. Before making our
toilet, coffee was served at our rooms in those beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>china cups which are found generally in the houses of the
better class of people. When I left my room, the Doctor was
found in the parlor waiting to receive us; and, knowing
that any thing from the United States, just now, would interest
us, he went out and procured some copies of the Presbyterian
newspaper, from the house of the Rev. Mr. Snyder,
which were particularly appropriate for the day. I called,
subsequently, and saw Mrs. Snyder; but, not finding Mr.
Snyder at home, her tender of hospitality was declined for
the present time.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Wood and the rest of the party arrived in time
to join us at a very late breakfast, and it was really a feast
of fat things, in great variety and much good taste. I was
seated at one end of the table, with the lady of the house
upon my left hand, and I made such use of my limited
stock of Portuguese as was necessary in communicating
with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of our companions proposed to go to Ybicaba to-day,
while the General and myself, with Mr. Snell, as interpreter,
concluded to remain quietly here; and I wrote a
lengthy communication for my friends, and also a letter
to my wife, as appropriate Sunday-work.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of us dined together; and the most bountiful supply
was arranged in the greatest elegance upon the extended
table, with a huge, fat turkey dressed in the best style,
from the carving of which the General relieved our hostess.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Our kind hostess furnished us with a cup of most excellent
chocolate, before breakfast, this morning, though coffee
had already been served prior to leaving our rooms. The
General said that all his needs were supplied by this nutritious
drink, and becoming very impatient at the delay of
breakfast, proposed to go without waiting for it. But Dr.
Gattiker would not hear of our going without breakfast;
and, indeed, after breakfast, we had great difficulty in getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>off from him, as he insisted we must spend the day at
his house. I was favored with photographs of the Doctor
and his wife, which will be treasured up in the collection of
my friends in Brazil—she being a native of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon starting, it was found that my mule was suffering
from the loss of a shoe, and it became necessary for me to
stop on the road, that he might have it replaced. General
Wood and Mr. Snell, in the mean time, adopted my suggestion,
and proceeded to Ybicaba. As the camaradas were
behind, I awaited their arrival, and, taking one of their
mules, he remained to bring mine when it was shod.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made a fruitless attempt to advance upon this lazy and
perverse mule, but at length, in despair, stopped upon the
roadside, and dismounted to await the arrival of my own.
Here, in the wild forest, it occurred to me that a tiger or
other wild beast might attack me, but I congratulated myself
that I could get out of the way faster on foot than upon
this stupid animal, and it might be that the carnivorous propensity
of the wild occupant of the woods would be satisfied
with the tough carcass of the old mule, which I would
leave to his tender mercies.</p>

<p class='c007'>I thought we had started with some of the most shabby
animals that the province could afford, but some of those
which were left at Ybicaba by General Wood’s party were
even worse than the two left by us. These animals were
such as had been in use for the military service, and were
turned out upon such pasturage as the lands around the
city of São Paulo would furnish, which, from notice under a
former date, may be inferred would not have the effect of
improving their flesh or strength. Of such as the President
had, gave he unto us; and we were thankful for the small
service they rendered in getting us to places where we were
generously supplied by our friends with better animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few of the public animals were retained for the trip by
General Wood’s party, and we kept two mules in service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>that were improved by the regular feeding, with comparatively
light work under our pack-saddle.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we are booked to remain as the guests of Senor Vergueiro
to-morrow, it is expected that some of the camaradas
will proceed with this drove of emaciated horses and mules
in advance, so as to allow them to move leisurely. Some
of them are scarcely able to drag their bare bones along,
and they will accordingly go in light-moving order, without
incumbrance of any sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire number of horses and mules belonging to both
parties amounts to thirty-three, and there are about one-half
the number belonging to parties at different points on
the road, who had furnished them for the expedition, while
perhaps there are a half dozen of the public animals in
service, leaving ten of the nondescripts going loose.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Dom João Guilheoma D’Aguier Whitaker, Juiz de Direita,
da Comarca de São João de Rio Claro, informs us
that he has been directed by his family connection and
friends to put at the service of our people, when they may
arrive at Santos, a sufficient number of mules to transport
them and their effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Vergueiro has furnished General Wood with thirty-six
different varieties of wood, which are to be found in the
district of Lemaire, and suited to different domestic purposes,
of which the names are given below.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>These specimens of wood represent the useful growths of
timber in this district of the province of São Paulo, and
there are likewise a great number of palm trees, different
qualities of cane, (bamboo and taqueira,) with a variety of
vines, of which the sipo is especially valuable for cordage
and other uses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The guaranta is the best material for fencing, as it splits
readily and is very durable. The hardness of most of the
wood in this country is the most serious obstacle to using
it in the form of plank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Specimens of the following-named grasses have likewise
been furnished to General Wood:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gramminha.</div>
      <div class='line'>Gramminha fina.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pé de galinha.</div>
      <div class='line'>Passuam.</div>
      <div class='line'>Cassium Gerdura.</div>
      <div class='line'>Gramma Naturæ.</div>
      <div class='line'>Gramma larga.</div>
      <div class='line'>Cassium Milham.*</div>
      <div class='line'>Cassium Angelinha.*</div>
      <div class='line'>Cassium de Angola.*</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Those marked thus * are suitable for cutting and curing
as hay, and we find this fazendeiro has a considerable
amount dried and stored away for use as may be required.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>As there is no frost here to destroy the grass, and animals
can run upon the pastures throughout the year, very
few persons think it necessary to cure hay, yet these high
grasses are cut and fed to milch cows, or to horses that are
not put out to graze, and thus they are very useful.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the cooler months of winter, and when there is a
protracted drought in the warm season, none of the grasses
grow so luxuriantly, and the grazing is of course much impaired,
so that it is very convenient to lay up a supply of
hay, as is done at this place during the season of full development,
and retain it to meet emergencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>This region of country is more particularly adapted to
agricultural operations, and makes a better return under
cultivation than to be used for pasturage, yet grass is produced
of the best quality when it is allowed to grow naturally
or the land is planted artificially with either the seed
or the radicals of the different grasses. One of the varieties
of cassium is propagated entirely by transplanting the roots,
from which it extends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Combining a notice of the habits and customs of the
people with a record of their material resources, it is my
privilege to note the entertainment given us to-day by our
host. Quite a number of his friends were invited to join
us at dinner, and the preparations for the feast were most
elaborate. There were twenty-six persons seated at the
table, including the lady of the house, whose quiet dignity
gave a grace to the elegant style in which all was arranged.
Our party were seated in juxtaposition to each other, General
Wood being in the middle, and having Dr. Warne on
his left hand and myself on his right. On the opposite side
to us was seated Mr. Henry Whitaker, who was to act as
interpreter. From this portion of the table there extended
at right angles two wings, at which the other guests were
seated, Senor Vergueiro being at the end of one of the
wings and Dom Whitaker, Juiz Direita, at the end of the
other. Senhora was seated at one of the angles adjoining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the portion of the table occupied by our party, and thus as
will be perceived entirely separated from her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>A description of the numerous dishes, and the many varieties
of liquors and wines, is out of my power, as it was
far more extensive than we are accustomed to see at a
dining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in the progress of the substantial part of the dinner,
Senor Vergueiro arose and addressed those present as
to his object in thus assembling his fellow-citizens with us
around his table, closing with a sentiment complimentary
to all our party, and mentioning by name General Wood
and myself. To this the General responded at considerable
length, closing with a toast to our host and hostess, when
I made some remarks and toasted the authorities of Brazil,
and the counties of Rio Claro and Lemeire; Dr. Warne
responded to a sentiment from Judge Whitaker, and gave
a toast, and, in like manner, Mr. Kernan being called out,
made a few remarks and gave a toast.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the remarks in either language were interpreted by
Mr. Whitaker as the speakers proceeded, each making a
pause between sentences, and thus all was mutually understood,
giving the whole proceedings a fine effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large proportion of the Brazilian guests joined in the
expression of sentiments welcoming our people to this province,
and manifesting much interest in the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>After spending an hour at the table Mrs. Vergueiro retired,
much after the style with us, and the festivities were
kept up for three hours, amidst the most vociferous cheering
and singing. This reminded me very much of some of
the public dinners of our associations or societies, and we
could scarcely realize that it was merely a collection of
gentlemen at a private house.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the scenes at the table were ended, by a toast to
the Emperor, the company went to the saloon adjoining the
dining-room, and engaged during the evening in various
stag dances and comic plays. Even blindman’s buff was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>joined in by the parish priest, who was in attendance, and
seemed to enjoy the sports hugely. Some of the recreations
consisted in rehearsals of the pastimes of the lower
order of people (called here caipira) when they have gatherings
in the country, such as we would style a frolic or
break-down.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Wednesday</span>, <i>November 15, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>A large portion of the company having spent the night
under the hospitable roof of our host, they left early this
morning for their homes, and we were served with an early
breakfast preparatory to our renewing our travel. Arriving
at the villa of Lemeira, we stopped a short time at the
house of Captain Lonço Franco, who took such a fancy to
his brother larador (farmer) Mr. Brown, that he presented
him with a likeness of his wife. Ale, wine and brandy
were produced for the company, but we found much difficulty
here, as elsewhere, in procuring water to drink, from
the fact that no pails or buckets for holding water are ever
kept in their houses. The article ordinarily used is a sort
of earthenware jug or large bottle, but this is frequently
not supplied with water, and it consequently has to be sent
off to be filled when water is desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as I have observed there are no wells in this country,
and upon inquiring why they were not used, the statement
was made that there was no need for them, as there
is an abundance of fresh running water to be found everywhere.
The proximity to a spring seems to be a matter
of little moment, and consequently the water is not often
found very cool. Indeed, ice seems to be in very little demand
in the cities, as there are machines for its manufacture
at several points, which are not employed, and yet this
article sells in Rio de Janeiro for ten cents per pound by
retail.</p>

<p class='c007'>We proceeded to the inn at the bridge of Atibaia for dinner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and afterwards to another inn at Quilambo, where our
party spent the night.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>November 16, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Snell having gone forward last night to Campinas,
where he resides, was requested to advise Senor Joaquim
Bonifacio D’Amaral, alias Settequéda, that we would come
to his house this morning for breakfast. Moving accordingly
at an early hour, we rode sixteen miles, and upon
entering the city, we met our friend, Senor Joaquim, with
a party of other gentlemen on horseback, who came out to
escort us to his house in Campinas.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is eminently becoming that honor should be given
where it belongs, and therefore, as a matter of history, I
will state that General W. W. W. Wood was the object and
prime cause of these demonstrations made at different
points upon our route. Prior to joining him, I saw nothing
of this kind of display on the part of the people, and pursued
a very quiet business-like course in my associations
with the inhabitants of the different sections visited. As
there is nothing else to occupy my attention in passing
again over the road previously travelled, it is very satisfactory
to witness these manifestations in behalf of the representative
of seven States.</p>

<p class='c007'>We found every thing in complete order upon our arrival,
and rooms with the neatest possible outfit for each of us.
After washing and getting a cup of coffee breakfast was
announced, and the ladies of the house were met in the
dining-room, when I advanced and shook hands as with
old friends. Senhora seemed to take quite an interest in
my small acquisitions in Portuguese since my previous
visit to the family, and I was encouraged to use all in my
power, talking for myself and a little likewise for the General
and others seated near me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Reinhardt and Dr. Vaz, practitioners of the city,
were met here, and the former coming some years ago from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the United States, speaks our language fluently; while
the latter uses some words and sentences of English, but
slowly and imperfectly. I attempted to talk Portuguese
to him while he responded in English, and we managed to
communicate most matters that either desired to speak.
As there were quite a number of the gentlemen of the city
invited to breakfast with us, I made the acquaintance of
some of the best people in the place, and renewed my acquaintance
with Senor Joaquim Egydio de Sonsa, who
is not so demure as he seemed upon my former meeting
with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He accompanied Dr. Vaz, Dr. Warne, and myself to
his city residence, for the purpose of eating jaboticabas;
and while I enjoyed the fruit, I was much more favorably
impressed with his bearing than previously. We saw
there, also, a specimen of the small stingless bee of this
country, which makes its receptacle for the honey in the
hollow of a tree or the crevice of a wall, and affords the
most delicious article that is ever made by any of the bee
class.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a variety of fruit trees in the garden of this
gentleman, and among them a specimen of the peach;
which was, however, of inferior quality, as are all seen in
any part of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large company was invited to join us at dinner to-day,
and the entertainment was most sumptuous; with a
fine turkey in addition to a fine old ham, and other meats,
and as a compliment to the dessert, a plum pudding held a
conspicuous place. This last delicacy was dressed in a way
that I have not been accustomed to see; loaf sugar being
placed over it, and then Cognac brandy poured upon this,
and set on fire by a strip of paper which accompanied the
lighted candle. I confess in this matter to have shown my
greenness, as I really did not understand the programme
until it was explained to me; and this account of the after dinner
scene may enable some other person to avoid showing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>their ignorance. This dish is called here by its English
name, <i>plum pudding</i>; and in like manner, <i>roast beef</i> is
known by this name among the best families.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was quite surprised when asked by the lady of the
house, “Quere plum pudding?” and upon inquiry I was informed
that when this article was imported the name was
imported with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we were yet engaged with the meats, Dr. Vaz
arose, and representing our host, made a short speech of
welcome to us, and closed with a sentiment embodying all
by name. To show his appreciation of the compliment,
the General made rather a lengthy address for a dinner table,
and toasted the Emperor of Brazil and the province
of São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a few preliminary remarks, I gave the sentiment
that Settequéda and São Lorenço would long be remembered
as the homesteads of our best friends. Dr. Warne
premising some remarks, toasted our host and hostess.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Wood not being well, begged to be excused, and
retired to his room before the exercises were concluded,
when Dr. Vaz went out to minister to him. Commendador
Egydio and Senor Dom Pinto made addresses complimentary
to our people, and calculated to encourage our
movement to this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remarks on this occasion were interpreted by Mr.
Bennaton, as each speaker proceeded, and quite an awkward
scene occurred from the deafness of Dom Pinto, who
had not perceived that the remarks were interpreted; and
when he rose to speak, afforded no opportunity for the interpreter
to repeat his words; who consequently had to
abandon the undertaking and leave the Dom to proceed
without any prospect of being understood by our party.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner I went with Dr. Reinhardt to his house
and received much information as to the country and the
medical profession of the city. He tells me that the physicians
here realize from $5,000 to $7,000 per annum, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>that the plantations of coffee around the place afford a
considerable share of the business. He thinks of coming
to the United States after a few years for the purpose of
educating his children, having married and raised a family
in Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most attractive feature of the hospitalities of Senor
Joaquim Bonifacio was the party given in the evening, at
which there were present many of the elite, with several very
pretty and sprightly young ladies. The daughters and
wife of Dr. Vaz were introduced to me and others of our
party by himself; and these fine-looking and elegantly-dressed
young ladies were the stars of the evening, though
there were others who were much admired by the gentlemen
of our party. General Wood having recovered from
his indisposition, danced with several of the ladies, and
appeared the gayest among the gay. Dr. Warne also
danced several rounds, and even enjoyed the intimate relations
of a waltz with the younger daughter of Dr. Vaz.
The older daughter had the lower part of her fine skirt
torn in the dance, and in assisting her to pin it up, I made
a blunder, by saying “sua vestida muito ruim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea that I wished to convey was, that her dress was
in bad condition from this accident; but I learned afterwards
that the true import of my words was, Your dress is
very worthless. It is to be hoped, however, that she
would attribute it to my ignorance, though I observed at
the moment that she had rather a peculiar expression of
dissatisfaction, and made no reply to my remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>The music on this occasion was very superior; there
being one band with brass instruments at the outer front
door where the company were assembling, and another
band which made music for the dancing when it began
about 9 o’clock in the evening. At the close some pieces
were performed upon the piano by a gentleman, and accompanied
by a cornet-a-pistons, which received the undivided
attention of the assemblage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The refreshments were served upon waiters by the gentlemen
in attendance, and the wants of every one were
looked after assiduously. This is a feature of difference
that will strike all as corresponding to the courtesy alluded
to in regard to rendering assistance in mounting, and more
remarkable in a slave country where the houses are supplied
with excellent servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tea, chocolate, and coffee were handed, with quite a
variety of cakes and sweetmeats; while at the close of the
evening, or rather the morning, for it was then 2 o’clock
A. M., a concentrated chicken-soup was served in teacups.
This struck me as very proper to meet the exhaustion incident
to the active exercise and loss of sleep at this late
hour, and yet it was new.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the want of a common tongue was embarrassing
to all parties, the evening passed very pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>While there was much elegance and many conveniences
connected with the large establishment in which we were
quartered, we were surprised to learn that there was no
privy about the place, and the only alternative was the use
of chamber-pots in the rooms for all the uses of such places.
The repugnance felt with American gentlemen to this proceeding
is not lessened by the necessity of their situation
in the midst of a city, and one of the improvements much
needed in the domestic arrangements of this country is the
addition of latrines to their premises. If a room was set
apart for offices of this kind, it would obviate some of the
embarrassments; yet a neat privy kept in good order is a
very genteel appendage to an establishment; and by inviting
to the regular discharge of the functions of the intestinal
canal, it exercises a beneficial influence on health, and
the general comfort of a family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon being introduced to a lady in the house as the sister
of our host, I was informed by him that she was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>mother of his wife, which of course makes him the uncle of
his wife. Had I not found previously that this kind of marriage
takes place here very frequently, and that among the
best class of people, it would have been regarded as a matter
of too much delicacy to refer to in a record of this kind.
In three instances, of the most intelligent and most refined
people met with in this country, the lady is the niece of her
husband, and I must forbear to express my convictions of
the consequences that must be entailed upon posterity by
this course.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was arranged that we would leave this morning; and,
in consideration of the temporary illness of the General last
evening, a carriage was provided, with four horses, to convey
him to Jundiahi, and Mr. Bennaton takes a seat with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of us being ready to go in advance, moved off on
horseback, escorted out to the edge of the town by Senor
Joaquim Bonifacio and several of his friends. He pointed
out on the way a number of houses occupied by Germans
who were formerly colonists upon this place, and also their
school-room filled with children, which, taken together, indicates
that they are getting along prosperously in their new
homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped upon the road to-day at an inn (hospidaria)
kept by one of these German families, who had collected a
considerable property in a few years, and they now have a
plantation with several slaves, in connection with a thriving
house of entertainment for travellers. Most of those who
entered business originally with some of the Fazendieros as
colonists, have since attained to a moderate competency,
and settled themselves upon small farms or engaged in mercantile
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Campinas is surrounded by large and flourishing coffee
plantations, and is the residence of many wealthy planters,
yet I understand that there is not much trade of any kind
conducted in the city. Should the projected railroad be
built in a reasonable time, it will enhance the importance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>this city vastly, and it will then become attractive as a
location for business and as a place of residence for families.
I await the result with a feeling of interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our route to-day we found that three out of the number
of disabled public animals had been left at different
points, as it was impracticable for them to travel with the
train, while the others proceeded to our place of stopping,
within one mile of Jundiahi.</p>

<p class='c007'>This inn, kept by Senor José Pinto, is a fair sample of
these houses of entertainment for travellers, and though we
were molested with fleas as we went up, the general provisions
for our accommodation were as good as are usually
found at these places. There are two young women about
the house, who are daughters of the proprietor, and don’t
seem to have any fear of strangers, attending promptly to
all their wants. The proprietor, who is generally known
as Barão (the Baron), is immensely corpulent, and locomotes
as little as possible, yet he learns every thing that can
be communicated by persons passing in either direction,
and is regarded as the best authority for what is going on
in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the small forest hogs, called tité, that are abundant
in some regions we have visited, was seen domesticated
at this place. It looks very much like we might expect
a cross between a hog and a goat to appear, being of
a gray color, and without any tail, but with a head corresponding
very much to that of the ordinary swine.</p>

<p class='c007'>This animal rarely exceeds fifty pounds weight, and is an
excellent article for the table, the flesh being delicate and
tender. The woman who owned this desired to sell it to
us, but as our transportation was not suited for the accommodation
of life-stock, it had to be left for some other
purchaser.</p>

<p class='c007'>A well-assorted and abundant supply of eatables was
sent by our hostess at Campinas to meet our wants for the
day, and nothing was required at the inn.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Being aroused early this morning we were served with a
cup of coffee by Barão, and prepared for the road. The
General rode into the villa of Jundiahi in the four-horse
carriage, and there dismissing the driver and equipage to
return to Campinas, he mounted his mule again, feeling
much reinforced for the journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the camaradas was sent back by Mr. Bennaton with
money to pay for the attention given by parties on the road
to the disabled animals, and with instructions to bring them
forward leisurely, so as to return them to the government
authorities at São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I did not care to remain at Jundiahi, while the General
was undergoing the transfer from his four-horse carriage
to the mule, I came on in advance and reached the
house of Mr. D. H. Sampson at Cachoeira about 9 o’clock.
My kind friend here expressed his satisfaction at my return;
and when informed that the rest of the party were on the
way, he proceeded to order breakfast for all.</p>

<p class='c007'>We soon heard the sound of the horn, which General
Wood had carried with him throughout the tour, giving his
signals for moving or stopping, and on various other occasions
as his fancy dictated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire party rested at Cachoeira until the afternoon,
when the General and his party proceeded to an inn called
Peru, twelve miles distant; and Mr. Bennaton remained
with me for the night, under the hospitable roof of friend
Sampson.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Rising before daylight, the French cook Philipe, who has
charge of Mr. Sampson’s establishment, gave us a cup of
coffee with bread and butter, and we mounted our mules for
a direct ride of twenty-eight miles to São Paulo. The excellent
mule which had been furnished me by Mr. Gephardt
for the trip was placed at my service by Mr. Sampson for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the ride to the city; and I feel under the greatest obligations
to these gentlemen for their disinterested kindness to
me in this and in other matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spirit of accommodation manifested by Mr. D. H.
Sampson, with his acts of generosity to myself and others
who have come from the Southern States, makes us realize
that the interest he has taken in our cause is extended to
us; and for myself, I shall always feel grateful to him for
his substantial favors, and his courteous attentions extended
to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>In following the grade of the railway we passed the termination
of the iron rail twelve miles from the city of São
Paulo, and learned from a man engaged on the road that
there would be an interruption of some months, from a land-slide
at the Serra de Santo having stopped the transportation
of iron. This serra is likely to be a very serious obstacle
to the success of the road, as even when in working
order the inclined plane, with four stationary engines to
draw up the cars, is an inconvenient arrangement, and not
by any means free from danger. The effect of these repeated
land-slides must be unfavorable to our prospects of
making a settlement in the interior, and it thus becomes
more important to ascertain whether some other locality
may not prove more advantageous.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached São Paulo at noon, General Wood and his
party having arrived an hour previously.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast and a bath, I walked down to give a letter
to Mrs. Blackford from her husband, and to inquire for
letters from my wife and friends. It was a great disappointment
to find no letters here, nor at the post-office; and my
only hope now is, that there may be letters for me at Rio
de Janeiro, on my arrival there.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the afternoon I was called upon at the Hotel da
Europa by Senor João Ribeiro de Santos Carmargo, and at
the same time General Wood was visited by Senor Dom
Joaquim Antonio Pinto, Junr.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The question of an emigration association being presented
by General Wood to Dom Pinto, he said that he would confer
with his friends in regard to such an organization. He
made out a list of names that would probably be favorably
disposed in this matter, and that would be requested to
meet here to-morrow at 12 o’clock, in regard to the plan of
proceeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was found this afternoon that one of General Wood’s
trunks, containing specimens of coffee, wood, and grass,
was missing; and as it was supposed that the camarada
Manoel, or the servant Fortunatus, should be held responsible
for its return, the police were advised of the facts and
arrested the former, committing him to jail for further investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>This trunk had been taken first to the quarters of
Senor Street, under the impression that it contained articles
belonging to him; but on finding that it was to go to the
hotel, the camarada intrusted it to a negro that was not
personally known to him, and nothing has been heard of it
since.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With a view to dispose of the matter referred to last in
my previous record, I may state that General Wood had
the camarada Manoel released from confinement this morning.
He then set about investigating the locality of the
negro man to whom he had given the trunk, and while we
were at dinner, Manoel came in with the trunk, exciting the
sympathy of all present by his manner, and the known fact
of his innocence as to the miscarriage of the trunk. It
seems, according to the statement, that the negro brought
the trunk to the hotel, but not knowing the name of the
person for whom it was intended, he remained for a time,
and then, with a view to secure his fee when it was delivered,
took it to his own quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>In compliance with the request of General Wood, I wrote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>out to-day for him a report of the recent tour and examination
of the lands of Araraquara and Jahu, with a proposition
to adopt this region as a location, if proper facilities
can be afforded by the government of Brazil. He expects
to submit this to the President of the province of São Paulo
during an audience to-morrow, and it is supposed that this
official will recommend measures for accomplishing the object
in view to the Minister of Agriculture at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was asked by the General to go to his room for an introduction
to the gentlemen assembled there, for conference
as to an association to promote emigration, and found the
following persons present: Senor Dom Joaquim Antonio
Pinto, Junr., Senor Dom Bernardo d’Avelino Gavião,
Senor Dom Fidelis Nepormecino Prates, Senor João Ribeiro
de Santos Carmargo, Commendador Vicente de Sonsa
Queiroz, and Senor Dom Martinho da Silva Prado.</p>

<p class='c007'>I accompanied General Wood to-day to call upon the
President of the province at 12 o’clock, and the General
handed him his report, with the map of the country traversed,
as made out by Mr. Street, the engineer, who accompanied
him throughout the tour. The General made some
remark in regard to my co-operation with him, which being
interpreted to the President, he desired to know if I concurred
with General Wood in considering these lands desirable
for my friends, and whether he would be authorized
to state this fact to the Minister of Agriculture. I replied,
that of the lands which had been examined I was most
pleased with those included in the limits indicated; though
it might then have been further stated that I had not seen
all that was desirable to enable me to make a proper selection.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 4½ o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> we met the gentleman who called yesterday
at General Wood’s room, at the palace of the President,
where this official was present, with the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>other persons of distinction, viz.: Barão de Itapetininga,
Barão de Ignape, Barão de Rio Claro, Dom Luiz Antonio
de Sonsa Barros, Dom Silveirio Rodriquez Jordão.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a short period of silent suspense, General W. W.
W. Wood rose, and with Mr. Bennaton as interpreter, proceeded
to lay before this dignified and highly respectable
assemblage his views in regard to the objects to be attained
by the organization of a society to promote emigration to
Brazil, and especially to this province. But he concluded
with referring any action that might be thought proper to
the discretion of those present who might feel interested
in the movement. He subsequently requested that Dom
Gavião would give his views to the meeting, which he did at
some length without rising from his seat; and as Mr. Bennaton
stated subsequently, quite favorably to the object in
contemplation. General Wood then made a few remarks
further, touching the subject under consideration, at the
close of which I suggested that we should retire, and leave
our Brazilian friends to deliberate freely upon all points they
might desire to discuss. It was accordingly so announced,
and we took our leave of this select assemblage.</p>

<p class='c007'>I called early this morning upon Senor Bento Alves, No.
10, Rua do Commuveio, to make arrangements for visiting
a fazenda, called Bananal, some sixteen miles from the city.
Finding he had but one animal at hand, I had to wait until
next day for him to procure one for me, and we expect to
go to-morrow morning at 6 o’clock, without any interpreter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The result of the meeting yesterday was the formation
of an association to promote emigration, with the following
appointment of officers:</p>

<p class='c007'>For President, Barão de Ignape.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Vice-President, Commendador Queiroz.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Draft a Constitution, Commendador Queiroz, Dom
Bernardo Gavião, and Dom Pinto, Junr.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Thus we have the initiation of a very important movement
for the interest of those who may come from the
Southern States to this province; and the only feature that
strikes me unfavorably is, that the president is quite an
old man, without that energy which a younger person could
bring to the work. If it can be brought into that practical
and efficient operation which the expressions of favor would
warrant, we may confidently rely upon something being
effected for the advantage of emigrants from the Southern
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>I rode with Senor Bento Alvez to-day, to visit the Fazenda
Bananal; and though he understood nothing of English
I managed to use enough Portuguese to make him
understand me, and I guessed pretty successfully at what
he said to me on the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first five miles of our route was over a most excellent
public highway, to the Frequezia Penha, which has cost
the province a round sum of money; but there are very
few buggies or carriages to enjoy this fine drive. I was
especially struck with the great number and variety of
crosses, made of wood, that stood upon the roadsides after
passing this little village; and my travelling companion
never came opposite to one, without raising his hat, as an
act of religious veneration. Some of these crosses indicate
that a death has occurred near, or serve as a talisman.
It is so common to see a cross upon the roadsides, in
various portions of this country, that I have endeavored
to get some intelligible explanation of their design; but
no one seems to have any more satisfactory solution than
that these people think that they secure some immunity
from all harm by the presence of a cross. They are seen
very frequently at the forks of roads, at the point where a
family path leads into the main road.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a murder has occurred at any particular spot, there a
cross is certainly erected; and as murders were very ordinary
occurrences throughout certain portions of this country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>in former years, it may be that most of the crosses, remote
from dwellings, indicate the site of a murder. These crosses
are frequently covered by a small house, and garlands of
flowers will sometimes be seen, either fresh or decayed,
upon them. There is a basis of superstition connected
with all this, which the intelligent Roman Catholics of
Brazil ignore and lament; yet the mass of the people, in
their ignorance, continue to practice these things with a
reverential awe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In lieu of breakfast we stopped at a wayside inn, and got
a cup of coffee, which was enjoyed with my cold lunch of
beef and bread given me by the landlady at the Hotel da
Europa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being now in good riding-trim, and being mounted upon
an easy-going horse, I took the lead, so as to hurry up my
Brazilian friend. He is of Spanish extraction; and not
much more of the go-ahead in his composition than pertains
to the character of most of these people, who have
grown up under the idea that to-morrow is as good as
to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon entering the lands of the fazenda we first encountered
an extensive level plain, which is called “campo
largo.” This was covered with a short grass, that seemed
to be relished by the cattle and horses which were grazing
upon different parts of it. The cattle seemed in good
order, but the horses and a few mules looked shabby and
rather thin, as if they did not receive the same benefit as
the other stock from the grazing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soil was almost black, and with the use of the plough
might yield other grasses; or it might prove productive if
planted in corn or peas. Yet this experiment has yet to be
made, and is certainly attended with much doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>This campo largo is separated from the other land, that
lies more irregular in its conformation, by a stream of
water, such as we would style a creek. On the other side
of this the land ascends into a range of mountain elevations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>whose sides can only be cultivated with great difficulty
by the hoe. Upon these slopes the land is of a dark
gray aspect, corresponding more to the appearance of some
of the up-country lands in South Carolina than any I have
seen here.</p>

<p class='c007'>The houses composing the site of this fazenda are located
at the foot of this range of elevated land, and in a central
position as to the territory. There is a good dwelling, of
moderate size, having a plank floor, glass windows, and a
tile roof. The outhouses are inferior in quality, yet capacious,
and meet the needs of the establishment. A monjolo
is worked by water, brought in a race from the stream
spoken of, and there is an old apparatus formerly used for
grinding mandioca, which is now out of order, but might
be turned to practical account.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a plain, substantial dinner, the examination of the
lands was resumed, and we visited two sites where families
were located, but the positions were not well suited for
dwellings. Indeed, there are no good situations for the
residence of families anywhere on the place, as the chief
location is almost inaccessible from the irregularity of the
ground. An abandoned coffee-patch lies near the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quality of most of the land is inferior, and unfavorably
located for cultivation with a plough; and I felt satisfied
at sight that this place was not adapted for our purposes.
Being very tired I declined eating any thing for supper,
and retired to my quarters, where I found a very comfortable
bed arranged with musqueto-netting. The single bed,
corresponding very much in proportion to our hospital
bunks, is the most frequent in this country; and it is very
rare that a large double bed is found, except for family use
where there are children.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one view of this fazenda which might be worthy
of attention, and though evidently unsuited to the location
of a number of families, there is a large extent of territory
which is well adapted to grazing, and a cattle range can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>extended to public lands lying adjacent. There is a considerable
portion of elevated campo land, independent of
the level plain described as lowland, which would doubtless
suit very well for sheep and goats, as some of it is quite
rugged, and has clumps of trees, which would serve as
places of retreat in the heat of the day. Any one who
would desire to combine stock-raising with a farming business,
might do it here advantageously; and from the proximity
to the market of São Paulo, there would be a ready
disposition of all that could be grown.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A nephew of Senor Bento, who resides upon the Fazenda
Bananal, joined me this morning in riding across the mountain,
to take a survey of the forest land lying upon the slope
and crest of this elevation. I saw a few places in which
corn was growing very satisfactorily, and after reaching the
top of the ridge, found a portion of the ground whose configuration
was more favorable for cultivation, though most
of it lay quite irregularly.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing worthy of further notice save a most
beautiful lake, far above the surrounding country, enclosed
by hillocks, and having a dense forest lying upon one side.
It is fed by a number of small rills, and perhaps also by
internal springs, while there is but one outlet, forming a
large stream, which has a most picturesque cascade at a
short distance from the lake. This placid lake, which is
known as “tanque grande,” with the bold stream leading
from it into the forest, and then dashing down a rocky
gorge, presents the most attractive feature of this fazenda.
The lake is said to be very deep, and contains a large number
of excellent fish. It might become very profitable as a
place for the culture of fish, to supply the market of São
Paulo, as the outlet could be so guarded by an iron grating,
or a network of sipo, as to prevent the escape of even small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>fish over the fall, and the fish could be caught with the
hook or other modes of capture on a larger scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the gentlemen and ladies of the city should desire recreation,
they could find no more pleasant resort than this
lago bonneto upon the mountain top, and close the day with
a fish-fry in the adjoining grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>This attractive spot is evidently not appreciated as a
specimen of the beauties of natural scenery, and few, perhaps,
excepting those rude and unlettered inhabitants of
this mountain region, know of its existence. Should a
traveller in Switzerland encounter such a rare combination
of beauties as is presented here, it would be sketched with
the greatest interest, and portrayed in the most enthusiastic
terms by the lover of nature. It is a quiet, clear sheet of
water, about three hundred yards in length, and about two
hundred yards in width, with the outlet as stated, running
into a dense forest. The lands around it have been cleared
up for cultivation, and run down with a gentle slope on all
sides to the margin. The vandal hand which cut away the
primeval growth around this lovely spot should be held responsible
for constructing a terraced walk around it, and
beautifying it with the choicest flowers and evergreens, so
as to compensate for the loss it has sustained in removing
the grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though I could not praise the soil, I expatiated in all the
variety of terms my vocabulary would afford, upon this exquisite
water-scene, yet my matter-of-fact companion met
my eulogy by the grave and business-like interrogation,
whether I was sufficiently pleased with my examination to
buy the fazenda, to which I was forced to give a negative
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I returned to the city with Senor Bento, we stopped at
the house of his brother, Senor Bonifacio, at the Fraguezia
Conceicão, and there enjoyed a bait of jaboticabas from the
trees that grew in a field near by. While in the house, a
servant was ordered to do something in which café and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>laranga (meaning coffee and orange) was heard, and supposing
these articles were being ordered for us, I excused
myself from taking coffee in the best Portuguese available,
when lo, it turned out that the words simply referred to
securing our horses in the grove near the trees of the above
name. Thus it is that an imperfect knowledge of language
gets one into difficulties on every hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun being very hot, I was kindly supplied with an
umbrella by a gentleman who joined us in the ride from this
place to the city, and though he was thus left unprotected,
there was no alternative but to accept it. These people are
frequently very self-sacrificing in their courtesies to others,
and though it has been said to me that their civilities are
only the outward show of politeness, I must say to their
credit, that nowhere can there be found more of the reality
of accommodation, and hearty readiness in rendering any
required aid, than among the people of this province.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon reaching São Paulo, I found that our baggage had
been sent to the office of the diligence to be forwarded to
Santos, and tickets were secured for us to proceed to-morrow
morning.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At a late hour last night, one of General Wood’s party,
Mr. W. C. Kernan, reached the hotel Europa from Ybicaba,
where he had been left sick. He accompanied me this morning
to the diligence station, and upon my statement that
Mr. Street would arrange for his passage, a seat was procured
for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>I found upon entering the diligence that Dom Pinto,
Junr., was a passenger, and he introduced me to Mrs. Burton,
the wife of the British Consul at Santos. She requested
me to take charge of her on the trip, which was done, and
upon arrival a servant was engaged to carry her baggage to
the hotel, but my proffer of attendance was declined, as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>said that she desired to give her husband a little surprise,
and would prefer to go up alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>She remarked that Captain Burton would be happy to see
me at any time, when I replied that it would afford me
pleasure to meet him if he should find it convenient to call
upon me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our passage in the diligence was made in the shortest
possible time, over the smooth road, to the top of the serra,
but a tedious descent was caused by some derangement of
the stop-block attached to the wheel of the diligence, and we
had rather a slow boat from Cubitão to the city of Santos,
where we arrived at 2 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>After proceeding a short distance from the landing, I
met a young man employed in the store of Mr. W. J.
Wright, and accompanied him to the office, where I found
the same cordial greeting and tender of hospitality which
had met me in passing here previously. His intelligent and
dignified lady subsequently received me with much kindness
also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their two interesting little boys, Billy and Henry, recollected
my former visit, and seemed likewise to welcome my
return, so that I really felt very much at ease in my social
relations to this pleasant family. After dinner we walked
out, together with the children, to a cool fountain a short
distance from the residence, and there enjoyed a sociable
conversation, sitting upon the green sward.</p>

<p class='c007'>I accepted the invitation of Mr. Wright to accompany
him and Mrs. Wright to the theatre at night, to hear the
bell-ringers and tumbler melodists. An intelligent young
Brazilian gentleman, Dom Augusto T. Coimbra, went with
us from the house, but I soon found that there was another
attraction in the building for him more potent than the skill
of the performers.</p>

<p class='c007'>After entering the box with Mr. and Mrs. Wright, I
bowed to General Wood, who was in the pit with the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>of the party, and upon his rising and bowing to me, he was
invited by Mr. Wright to come into the box.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came, accompanied by Mr. De Vi Valdi, United States
consul at this port, who not being in good odor with my
friend, Wright, was not presented to me, and after a short
time he requested General Wood to introduce him. After
the first performance, they returned to the seat with Dom
Pinto, Junr., the General and his party being his guests for
the evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of the bell-ringing was complete, and I was
particularly impressed with the execution of a piece called
Orpheus. But I did not find so much to admire in the
musical tones of the friction upon the different glasses,
though great skill and art were displayed by the operator.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though there was here a collection of the best people of
the city, there were but few fine-looking young ladies.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We were introduced to Captain Rudolf Julio de Balbi,
inspector of the port (Guerdamor) of Santos, who speaks
English, and went round the different parts of the custom-house
with the party. This is a large building, which was
formerly a nunnery, and though rather rude in its structure,
answers all the objects of the government at this port, where
but a small business is done, and yet with the prospect of
doing an extensive trade at a future day. This gentleman
took us in his boat to the arsenal landing, where the commander
of the port joined us, and some of the party getting
into his boat with the United States consul, we all went
aboard of the Santa Maria. After paying this mark of
respect to General W. W. W. Wood, these gentlemen took
leave of us and returned to the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four hundred soldiers destined for the seat of war were
embarked upon the steamer, and yet did not interfere with
the cabin passengers. All were well-dressed, and seemed
in fine spirits for the most part. A few, who looked rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>pensive and lachrymose at parting with friends, were rallied
by the others with much glee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The drummer of the band, who was a mulatto, with spectacles,
made a speech, in which there seemed to be a profusion
of patriotism, and closing with vivas for the cause,
and everybody and every thing associated with this regiment,
he drew forth the huzzas of all around him. Music
was next in order, and he belabored his huge bass drum
with as much energy as he had delivered his speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the officers afterwards rose, and shouting at the
top of his voice gave a series of vivas that were responded
to by huzzas from the troops, and the whites, mulattoes
and negroes all seemed alike exhilarated.</p>

<p class='c007'>This doubtless changed the current of feeling with many
who had left their homes reluctantly, and especially was it
salutary for those who had been dragged forcibly into the
service. Military duty appeals to the noblest elements of
man’s nature, but when the endearments of family and the
comforts of home are contrasted with the love of country
and the trials of the campaign, there are many in every
country who are disposed to shrink from the call to arms;
and the scenes which have been witnessed of men being
brought up with chains around their necks, is only an aggravated
exhibition of what occurs in most countries engaged
in war. Those who won’t do their duty voluntarily
must be required to do it under coercion.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we got upon the sea many of the officers and men
became sea-sick, and with the usual want of sympathy on
such occasions I observed one poor fellow, who was casting
his dinner over the rail, had two or three on each side of
him, who were jestingly going through the motions to taunt
him for his weakness of stomach. There were women accompanying
some of the men, but in what capacity is not
known, and in some instances they were sick, with their
heads resting against the breasts of the men, while in others
the men were sick, with their heads on the laps of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>women, who sat flat upon the deck. By the way, this is a
very common style of sitting among the common and middle
class of women in Brazil, using simply a piece of thin
matting to keep them off the dirt floor. Upon entering the
humbler class of houses you are likely to see, in a back
room, women with only a chemise and petticoat sitting
down in this way at work, who get out of view as soon as
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our steamer entered the harbor of Rio de Janeiro about
7 o’clock this morning, and at the police station a boat was
secured for us and our baggage, in which we came immediately
to the wharf and thence to the Exchange Hotel.
The total expense of boating and porterage for four of us
was but $2.00; which was less than I had to pay for myself
in getting from the steamer to the hotel in New York on
my way out. The porterage allowed negroes in Rio by
those who understand the terms upon which they can be
secured, is very small, not usually exceeding five cents for
a trunk or box to be carried several squares. But when
these darkies find a man who does not speak the language,
and consequently unacquainted with the usages of the place,
they make up for their shortcomings on other occasions.
When a boat or a porter is wanted, the best plan is to fix
your price, and call out for some one who will serve you at
the proposed rate, when the competition soon secures the
service from some of the number that are present at these
places on all occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our apartments at the Exchange Hotel are very comfortable
and even elegant, with all the usual appliances of a
well-furnished room. General Wood and Doctor Warne
are quartered together, while Mr. Brown and myself are in
another apartment. We have a sitting-room, bed-room,
and dressing-room, for which the charge is $2.50 per day;
while the more tasteful accommodations of the General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>and Doctor Warne are valued at $4.00 per day. These
charges are independent of our fare, which is paid for
according to what is ordered at each meal. We are upon
the same floor with the eating-saloon and quite convenient.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having a letter of introduction from Mr. Bennaton to
Mr. Carlos Nathan, I accompanied General Wood and
Doctor Warne to his establishment, No. 77 Rua São Pedro;
when he invited our party to dine with him and his brother
George residing in Botafogo. As he feared there might
be some disappointment in our finding the boat, he despatched
a servant to conduct us at 2 o’clock to the proper
place. The trip through the bay was very pleasant, and
our escort being a New York negro he spoke fluently of
the various interesting scenes, but still did not consider
Rio a very desirable residence for free gentlemen of color.
Arriving at Botafogo, it was found a most delightful, retired
nook, with neatness and taste displayed in the houses
and grounds, surrounding a small arm of the sea that extends
between the mountain cliffs on either side. This is,
perhaps, the most pleasant portion of the suburbs of the
city for a private residence; and every consideration of
economy, health, and retirement contributes to render this
locality desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wives of these two brothers are sisters, of the family
name of Goodman, from New Orleans, and speak French
quite as readily as English. Their houses are near each
other, and Mr. Brown and myself dined with Mr. Carlos
Nathan, while the other two dined with Mr. George Nathan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Carlos Nathan is manifesting more interest in the
emigration from the Southern States than any of the former
residents of the United States who live in Rio; and indeed
these two brothers are the only men here who were in the
South at the opening of the war, they having left to avoid
the consequences that seemed inevitable from the enemy’s
movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>While at breakfast this morning, I met with Messrs.
S. W. Brooks, Major Robert Meriwether, D. H. A. Shaw,
and Dr. Davidson, who arrived yesterday in the steam packet
North American from the United States. They
have come to examine the country in reference to business
and as a location for families. Dr. Shaw and Major
Meriwether are the regular agents of a colonization society
in Edgefield District, South Carolina, and bring with them
an appointment embodying instructions from the president
of the association.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the representatives of other parties they have adopted
the proper course in having authenticated credentials, which
may be exhibited to those here who may be called upon to
render them assistance in exploring the country. The
matter-of-fact bearing on the part of these gentlemen will
impress the officials of Brazil very favorably, and I trust
their investigations may be conducted in a way to lead to
most satisfactory results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Davidson is here to act for some friends in Texas,
while Mr. Brooks represents a company of machinists and
operatives who desire to establish a foundry and machine-shop
for working iron in all its various forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these gentlemen impress me with the earnestness of
their purposes and their business intentions, so that I hope
to co-operate with them in the farther examination of the
country; and will render them any assistance in my power
to promote their object. The same facilities will doubtless
be afforded by the government to them that have been extended
to others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having failed yesterday to find any one at No. 92 Rua
Direita, I called upon Mr. G. N. Davis this morning and received
a letter from my wife, which, however, was written in
August, and served very little to relieve the suspense felt in
regard to my family, as great anxiety is manifested in regard
to the future conduct of the negroes in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>This is the only information from any of my friends
since leaving on the 26th of June; and I am quite anxious
to know the present disposition of those who are expected
to act with us in the projected move to Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>I delivered a letter of introduction to-day to Mr. Joseph
Bennaton, No. 125 Rua Direita, from his nephew, Mr.
Newton Bennaton; whereupon he manifested a cheerful
readiness to promote my wishes, and extended an invitation
to sojourn at his house while I remained in the city.
I thanked him for his proffered hospitality, but stated to
him that circumstances made it desirable for me to stay at
the hotel, where persons could be seen on business. His
invitation to visit his family and take dinner to-morrow
afternoon was however accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>A copy of the handbook for emigrants to Brazil, arranged
by Dom Galvão, was received from him to-day by the hand
of his secretary. In this, he has compiled the laws and
public enactments of the empire of Brazil bearing upon
the relations of foreigners in becoming residents of the
country, with the regulations heretofore in force pertaining
to colonization. It is expected that important modifications
of the laws of Brazil will be made in regard to the
anticipated emigration of people from the south of the
United States, yet nothing has yet been definitely determined
on by the authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon calling this morning at the residence of the Minister
of Agriculture, he was absent, and a note was left for
him stating that I would return at ten o’clock to-morrow
morning with other gentlemen from the Southern States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shaw, Dr. Davidson and Mr. Brooks called with me
to-day upon Dom Galvão, and had a conference with him
in regard to the emigration movement. He was so kind as
to send his secretary, Mr. Mello, with us to one of the public
offices to procure maps of the lower provinces of Brazil.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>This latter gentleman speaks English as well as Dom
Galvão, and I accepted his invitation to go out to-morrow
afternoon and make the acquaintance of his mother’s family.</p>

<p class='c007'>I proceeded with Mr. Bennaton at four o’clock in the little
steamer to his residence in Caju, and found the scenery
in that precinct quite attractive, and his residence very
pleasant. His wife is a German lady, much younger than
himself, and they have three interesting little children. She
is a fine performer on the piano and sings admirably, but
as her pieces were mostly Italian I could not fully appreciate
her music.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner I joined them in a visit to Mr. Fox, who
resides in an elegant house upon the hill, which is surrounded
by grounds laid out in fine taste, and having the
additional attraction of most excellent grapes, imported
from the United States. He drew my attention to the fact
of his dwelling being much damaged by an insect which
destroys the texture of the wood and leaves the part without
support. I supposed it to be the same that had been
seen at the house of Mr. Blackford, where the interior of
the wood was reduced to a mere powder, with a thin exterior
layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>This injury to the texture of the wood may escape observation
unless there is a special examination of the particular
part, as the perforations by which these insects
enter the outer layer are very small, and all the fine sawdust
made by their operations remains within this outer
shell, that is not thicker in the specimen seen than coarse
white paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any iron rod, or even wooden pole, thrust against a piece
of timber affected in this way would cause it to yield and
fall into a hole, so that the damage might become in this
way apparent when their presence was suspected in a house.
But most of the heavy timbers being concealed, this mode
of testing is impracticable, and they give way, as the first
sign of the mischief going on within.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Mr. Fox has lived in Brazil for forty years, and conducted
a large and successful mercantile business, by which he has
realized a handsome competency, and has now retired. He
is an Englishman, and has retained his nationality, raising
his British flag on important occasions upon a flag-staff
which stands in his yard. His views are expressed unfavorably
to domesticating in Brazil, and yet his example of
spending most of his life here, with a prospect of continuing
here for the present, seems contradictory to his opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has not married, and yet has a senhora in his house,
who stands in that relation which induces many in this
country to dispense with a wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>He is now perhaps over sixty years old, and this buxom-looking,
dark-skinned woman is probably something over
thirty-five, officiating at his table and discharging the other
duties of housekeeper.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Being awakened at daylight, I accompanied Mr. Bennaton
in a row-boat to the city. He had business which required
his presence at his store very early, and as I wished
to confer with the other gentlemen at the hotel in regard to
matters for the attention of the Minister of Agriculture, it
was very desirable to both that this early move be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Meriwether, Dr. Shaw, Dr. Davidson, and Mr.
Brooks went with me at 10 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> to the residence of
the minister, and after presenting these gentlemen I explained
through the secretary, acting as interpreter, the
nature of their mission. The papers embodying the authority
under which they acted were submitted to the consideration
of the minister by Major Meriwether and Dr.
Shaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon learning that these latter two gentlemen desired to
visit the province of São Paulo, the minister stated that
they would be afforded the same facilities which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>received by others, and that they could likewise visit other
provinces if they were not satisfied after examining this.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it was intimated to the minister that I had not
seen all the parts of the province of São Paulo which I desired
to examine, and that it would be mutually agreeable
to visit such sections of country with these gentlemen, he
said this arrangement would be entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was understood that Senor Ernesto D. Street would
take charge of the voyage to Conceicão and Cananea, while
arrangements would be made for Mr. Bennaton to proceed
with us to other points in the interior.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Davidson, wishing to go to the Bay of Paranagua,
had similar facilities afforded for his passage and subsequent
examination of the adjacent country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Brooks explained his object in coming here from the
United States, to ascertain certain facts as to the location
of iron-works in Rio de Janeiro; and that this being the
centre of trade, it was not thought advisable to go elsewhere.
He stated that all the appliances were in readiness
to be brought here and put into operation should his information
warrant the move, but as yet he had not learned
those data upon which a conclusion could be based.</p>

<p class='c007'>I adverted to the probable advantages of some location
which could make the ore of Epanema available, and supply
not only all the domestic and agricultural implements
for the province of São Paulo and others adjoining, but
eventually make railroad iron for the extension of the line
in progress from Santos. The minister thought a situation
might be secured with this view that would prove very favorable
to business. But Mr. Brooks not being inclined at
present to extend his observations and inquiries beyond the
city of Rio, the minister assured him of his desire to encourage
the erection of such works, and that any assistance
which the government could consistently render would be
extended to this enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The minister stated that there was no tax on capital employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>in the various manufacturing operations, and that
no duty is exacted upon such implements as emigrants may
import upon their arrival in the country for their use.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professional men, as doctors and lawyers, are required
to undergo an examination upon coming here for the practice
of their respective callings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negroes are not admitted into Brazil from other countries
unless free-born, and even should they be citizens of the latter
after being in slavery, it does not authorize them to be
received here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding this a matter of much moment to those whose
negroes would be willing to come with them to this country,
I urged the importance of some modification of the existing
regulations so as to permit those presenting free-papers
from the United States government to enter Brazil.
But the minister informed us that it was a provision of the
constitution based upon international laws, that could not
be altered without a reference to the other powers concerned,
and, moreover, that this element would not be a
very desirable addition to the population of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certainly some aspects of the matter which
make it of questionable propriety to admit this particular
class of free negroes in a country where slavery exists, and
the influence of these freedmen upon other free negroes and
upon slaves in Brazil might tend to bring about similar
scenes to those which have been enacted in the process of
emancipation in the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, this skilled labor in the culture of
cotton and in the working of machinery of various kinds,
would be of much importance to the progress of agriculture
and the arts. The negro from the Southern States could
give negroes here a practical illustration in the use of the
plow, which would be worth more to Brazil than all the
treatises on agriculture which are likely to be written for
twenty years; and in this respect a few of these negroes
would prove very advantageous.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>It is evident, however, that Brazil regards the institution
of slavery as precarious, and we see already in the public
prints allusions to future emancipation, and measures suggested
for its gradual accomplishment, which are intended
to prepare the public mind for this event at no very distant
day. Where this question is discussed among a people
whose interests are so largely involved in slavery as in this
country, it may be taken for granted that there is a sentiment
of opposition to it which will by piecemeal attain the
end in view. The overturning of slavery by the result of
the war in the United States is simply a sequence of abolitionism
which has been at work for a series of years in shaping
the policy of the government; and it is found that the
same element is working industriously and too surely, for
the final consummation and realization of their views in
the securing of equal rights and free suffrage to the negro.
I do not intend to convey the idea that the institution of
slavery cannot be discussed with safety to the institution,
for I hold that it rests upon a basis that is tenable in a moral,
political, and social point of view; yet the presentation of
this subject in the public prints indicates that there are
many others besides those who write holding similar doctrines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English element of the population in this country is
antagonistic to slavery, and is quietly instilling this principle,
not simply by the expression of opinions, but in some
instances by aiding in the liberation of slaves through contributions
of funds for the purchase of freedom, and contracting
for the service of the party for a certain period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The minister informed us that no military service is exacted
from residents of Brazil who are not citizens, and
that only the service of home-guards is required from such
foreigners as are naturalized.</p>

<p class='c007'>No practicable measure has been devised for lessening
the price of private lands which may be desirable for emigrants;
but public lands will be put at the minimum price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of twenty-two cents per acre, with the privilege of five years
to pay for it.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I informed his excellency that no formal report of my observations,
up to this time, had been prepared, from the
fact that it was my wish to make a further examination of
the country, and that a final report, covering all, would be
rendered when this tour was concluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our way back to the hotel, the extensive and admirably
arranged tannery (cortuma) of Mello &#38; Co., in São Christovão,
was visited by the party; and we were quite surprised
to find so much taste and neatness displayed in the
surroundings of the place. The structures are not simply
substantial, but manifesting an architectural skill and perfection
of arrangement that is not often found in buildings
for similar purposes anywhere. The grounds are laid out
artistically, and ornamented with shrubbery and flowers, so
as really to make this place of business a pleasant resort.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interior is provided with all the appliances for treating
the hides, from packing them down, while fresh, in salt,
to dressing the leather and finishing it off for use. There
is a mill run by steam for grinding the bark and the leaves
of the manque bravo and the manque manse, which furnish
the astringent for making the tan ooze.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small tree affording these materials grows very abundantly
in the swampy lands near the coast in various portions
of this country, and the principle of tannin is so
strong in the leaves of the manque manse, that it makes a
black dye which is indelible. There are, also, other trees
growing in the forests here which furnish barks that are
used for tanning; one of which has been pointed out to me,
and is found upon the slopes of the serras in great profusion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>The vessels used in this establishment are huge reservoirs,
made after the style of a half-barrel, with a diameter
of five feet and a depth of three feet, into which a decoction
of the astringents is conveyed, and in this the hides are
deposited for a time, and afterwards laid down with astringents
in the vats, to undergo the tanning process.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three sets of vats: the fresh water vats for
soaking the recent hides, the liming vats, and the tanning
vats. These are all laid in cement, and of course retaining
all the fluids that are placed in them. The dimensions are
about six feet long, five feet deep, and four feet wide. The
fresh water is supplied by a system of pipes, and regulated
according to the demand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refuse angles of the hides, and also those portions
of the skin about the feet, with the hoofs, are converted
into glue, and every thing is economized with the greatest
care and neatness, preventing any bad smell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average period allowed for the action of the astringents
upon the hides is six months; and I was informed that
some three thousand (3,000) hides are taken out monthly,
giving thus an annual yield of thirty-six thousand (36,000)
skins tanned here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the apparent system of this extensive
establishment, I understand that it has not proved very
profitable to the proprietors; and it may be that there is
more style than efficiency in its management.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three other large tanneries in the suburbs of
the city; and, from the specimens of leather examined, the
art certainly seems to have attained a high degree of advancement.
Whether the materials ordinarily used here
are preferable to red oak bark, I have no means of determining.
In some sections, the logwood is a native growth,
and it is employed for tanning the heavy sole leather; but
this is not regarded the best quality of leather for any domestic
use, and is generally shipped to other parts where
heavy shoes are more in demand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Subsequent to the examination of the tannery, Dr. Shaw
and myself visited the butchering establishment, where the
greatest portion of the beef eaten in this little world of a
city is slaughtered, and the appliances are co-extensive with
the immense demand. Some of the machinery for securing
and killing the animals would afford an interesting item for
description; but, having no taste for this species of mechanism,
I will pass it over with the simple mention, that it is
evidently well adapted to the object in view. The huge
carcases that were suspended in the building were of the
well-defined varieties of Pharaoh’s cattle, and it occurred
to me that I should like to make my <i>choice</i> here of what I
should eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no general meat-market in Rio as in most large
cities; but there are houses in all the different streets who
deal in the flesh of different kinds, thus supplying all demands.
One of the noticeable features connected with this
butchering establishment is the immense collection of the
largest horns that have ever been produced in any country.
It would have afforded quite curious information to have
measured one of these tremendous developments; and,
most assuredly, the slang phrase of taking a horn never
had its origin from the use of those having such proportions
as were exhibited here. The cattle from the lower
provinces of Brazil, that furnish many of the beeves for
this market, are very large, and have the most disproportionably
large horns that it has fallen to my lot to see upon
the head of any animal, being, thus, of huge size.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the juices are extracted from the bones of the animals
that may be left on hand, or returned here for this
purpose, and soap is produced from it, while the substance
of the bone is reduced to a charcoal that commands a good
price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entrails of the beeves are also cleaned of every portion
of the tallow, and they are afterwards used for making
soap on the premises.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>The negro women engaged in this operation of washing
the intestines present quite a graphic scene. Instead of
using vessels of water, they carry a lot of these filthy things
into a canal of water which is located between the butchering-house
and the boiling establishment, and the water
being considerably above knee-deep, it behooves them to
have their clothing protected from getting wet at the expense
of denuding their entire lower extremities. Their
skirts are tucked about their waists, with a fold passing
round between the thighs, which thus gives a display of
nature unadorned.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to appointment, Mr. Mello called at my room
this afternoon, and Dr. Shaw, Major Meriwether, Mr. Brown
and myself joined him, to make a visit to the Botanical
Garden, and also to call at his mother’s house on the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking an outside seat on the hack, I enjoyed a good
view of all the scenery along the drive of five miles, and
found the many fine improvements and the beauties of nature
on the mountain sides very attractive. At several
points the road lay close by the water’s edge, and in one
locality the wall which had been erected as a barrier for the
waves had been undermined, and had tumbled down, with
a considerable caving in of the land, reducing our passage
to a narrow way. The lofty peak of the Corcovado was
towering above us, and the little rivulets of water coursing
down its sides glittered in the rays of the descending sun,
while here and there along its base were neat cottages or
palatial dwellings of those who sought refuge from the din
and confusion as well as the heat of the crowded city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Going forward, we reached the garden, with its grand and
gorgeous colonnade of majestic palm trees, which is doubtless
the most perfect type of quiet dignity and simple
beauty that the world can present. Much has been done in
rendering portions of these grounds artistically attractive,
and yet the beauties of art are overshadowed by the greater
beauty of nature presented in the forest that has been left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>upon the back of the garden. From this hillside there is
a stream of water tumbling down in artificial cascades, and
running on to form a beautiful lake upon the plain below,
all fringed with green.</p>

<p class='c007'>This retired spot has been selected by the authorities for
a collection of rare specimens of trees, fruits and flowers,
being hence styled the Botanical Garden. If any one desires
to study in a small compass, many varieties of
rarities, it may be done here advantageously, without a
guide, as the names of most of the unusual fruits are attached
to the trees by a metal card. The almond, the clove
and the cinnamon tree are among this interesting assortment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest taste has been displayed in laying out these
extensive grounds, and they have been most elaborately
supplied with attractions, making it quite a recreation to
stroll leisurely and quietly through the extended walks.
No one should go to Rio without visiting this place, and a
hack takes persons from Rua Direita directly to the gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon our return we stopped with Senor Mello, and found
his mother and three sisters presenting more of the characteristics
of our people than is usual among the ladies of this
country. Though none of them spoke English, I found that
my small acquisition in Portuguese availed to communicate
with them to a limited extent, and the kind disposition
manifested compensated for the lack of language to express
their good will towards us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another brother of the young ladies was also present
who speaks English, and with the aid of the two as interpreters,
all got on very pleasantly with our party during
the call.</p>

<p class='c007'>A nice repast, with beer, wine and brandy, was served in
the dining-room, and none of us having any difficulty in
comprehending this phase of the entertainment, all were
prepared to appreciate it. With the best wishes of the old
lady, we took our leave of the household.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>November 30, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>Going this morning to the office of Mr. C. Nathan for
some letters he proposed to furnish for our visit to Ignape
and Cananea, he sent a young man with us to the post-office
to assist in examining the lists, and to make inquiries for
letters. None however were found, and I must be resigned
to the failure of letters by the last packet from the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon returning, Lieutenant Fiske, formerly connected with
the Confederate Navy, called to learn something of my observations
upon the country, and finding that he had concluded
to return to the United States, I presented no consideration
calculated to change his determination, nor did I
feel disposed to develop my plans to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Malone came in for a short conference, in which he
expressed his decision to remain in the country with his
family. He and his lady had at one time a female school
in Memphis, Tennessee, and they will make a pleasant addition
to the group of settlers wherever they may locate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after these gentlemen left, Senor Street entered
and informed me that he was authorized by the Minister of
Agriculture to accompany myself, Dr. Shaw, and Major
Meriwether to Conceicão and Cananea, and that all would
be arranged for us to go aboard of the Santa Maria to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been informed that it would be agreeable to one
of the ministers who comes from Minas to see us, Mr. Mello
had undertaken to arrange for a meeting, but he returned
with the statement that his excellency would be in conference
with the other ministers and the Emperor to-day, so that
he could not see us for the present. As we leave early to-morrow,
our meeting with him must be deferred.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Dr. Shaw has concluded to make a memorandum of
matters desirable to be known respecting that province,
and get Mr. Mello to communicate with this honorable gentleman
from Minas, so that we may be informed at a future
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>day. One of the points of most interest to me is the facilities
for hiring negroes which are said to be afforded in some
parts of Minas, and it is desirable to know upon what terms
they will allow them to go to other sections of Brazil, for a
term of years.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the afternoon was spent in exploring the city of Rio
with Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether, for the purchase of
travelling-trunks, spurs, and a thermometer; whereas, an
application to some of our friends for the number and street
in which these things could be found would have cost us
but little trouble. Let others profit by this suggestion and
save time and labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though I had many personal matters of business to look
after, these gentlemen desired my assistance, as they were
totally unacquainted with the language, and there being no
other person to whom I could refer them, it devolved upon
me to accompany them. We spent a great deal of time unnecessarily,
and walked ourselves completely down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being very tired when I returned to my room at night, I
lay down upon a lounge to rest and did not awake until
11 o’clock. I then went down to search for a cup of coffee,
but found every place in the vicinity was closed; and for
once it occurred to me that coffee-houses might very appropriately
keep late hours. Most of the eating and drinking
establishments are shut up at 10 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> My
fatigue and drowsy mood found refuge in my bed for the
rest of the night.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Friday</span>, <i>December 1, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>Having a reserved stock of clothing in a chest at No. 92
Rua Direita, I selected this morning such articles as would
be requisite for the projected tour, and proceeded to pack
my baggage at a late hour, so that it was done in great
haste. Thus, some things of much importance were left in
the room, but as Mr. Brown retains the same quarters, I
trust he may find them and deliver them to Mr. Carlos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Nathan. If a word of caution can avail to induce others to
pack up all baggage on the night previous to an anticipated
journey, it will save them of all confusion and enable them
to employ the last moments before starting much more profitably.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shaw, Major Meriwether, and myself being in readiness,
negroes were employed to carry our trunks upon their
heads to the wharf, and we then availed ourselves of a row-boat
to proceed to the Santa Maria, which lay out some
distance in the bay. The three persons, with all baggage,
were taken for one dollar by previous contract, as I have
found that to be the best mode of doing business with these
boatmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our friend Mr. Mello was found on the steamer, having
accompanied some friends aboard. He introduced us to Dr.
Fogg, an American dentist, who has resided in Rio for
twenty years and realized a handsome income from his
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>He retains his citizenship in the United States, as do
most of those who have come from there to this country,
and none of them, so far as I have heard, encourage our
people to remove with their families to Brazil. We place
our own construction upon their statements, and prefer to
think and act independent of their advice.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Saturday</span>, <i>December 2, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>The arrangements upon the Santa Maria all proved very
satisfactory to Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether; and the
fare was in accordance with the usual good table of this
boat. A state-room with four berths was set apart for Mr.
Street in conjunction with us, making it a pleasant little
family party. Of course we enjoyed a refreshing sleep, and
rose to find ourselves approaching the city of Santos. Landing
at 8 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, I proceeded immediately to see my
friend Mr. Wright in regard to the measures for visiting the
lands near Conceicão. Finding his breakfast at hand I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>joined him and his family, and he afterwards came with me
to see the vicar (vigairo) of this district, who was acquainted
with persons in that section.</p>

<p class='c007'>He manifested much interest in the proposed visit, and
said that there was a person in town from there with whom
he would confer as to our trip. The aspect of affairs was
not very promising for an early move, as this individual
could not go to-day and did not know whether it would be
practicable to go to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time the other two gentlemen, Dr. Shaw and
Major Meriwether, were quartered at the Hotel Milan, and
I was a guest of Mr. Wright, while Mr. Street proceeded to
São Paulo to arrange with the President for the means of
defraying expenses on this voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>I dined at the house of Mr. Wright’s father-in-law, this
being his birthday, and that also of the Emperor, which
made it the occasion for quite a feast of good things.</p>

<p class='c007'>After concluding the ceremonies of the table the members
of the family all shook hands with each other, this being a
custom of constant observance among them after dinner,
even on ordinary occasions.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Learning that there was a site for buildings with some
lands attached, upon the seaside, which were offered for
sale, Mr. Wright went with us to see the place. He supplied
me with a horse, and the other two gentlemen were
supplied from the livery stable. A young man was sent by
the owner to show us the premises, and I observed that he
was riding a mare, which is the first time that one has been
observed in service anywhere in the country. In the stockgrowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>region they are confined to trading, and there
seems to be an impression that they are not suited for the
saddle or for pack service, as the valuation of mares is much
below that of horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>After riding five miles through the hot sun we found a
location which might, with a large outlay for improvements,
become a very nice residence for a family. It is at a point
where the serra approaches the water of the ocean, and thus
getting the full benefit of the sea-breeze. The property includes
a portion of the level low land with a portion of the
elevated land, and there is a small clear stream of water
running down the slope, which has been used in former days
for the machinery of a sugar-mill. From the antiquated
look of the relics, we might readily suppose that this was
the identical establishment erected by Martin Affonso in
1533, to work the cane grown in this region from specimens
procured in the island of Madeira. There is now only left
the stone basement of the old building, but the stream still
runs fresh and pure water that might again be used for some
mechanical purpose, or for other domestic uses of a family.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sunday</span>, <i>December 3, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>We made a commencement of this day in the right direction,
by going to church before breakfast, but it was not
with any reverential intentions. We ascended the high
hill, Monteserrate, to take a view of the large building there
located, and to enjoy the wide extended panorama to be
seen all around us. One old horse, that by some legerdemain
had accomplished the ascent of this lofty pinnacle,
and a few goats, as full of frolic and mischief as these animals
usually are, constituted the companions to the rather
dreary-looking inmates of the church building. It is only
upon extraordinary occasions that this church is brought
into requisition, and during my former visit to the city
there was an illumination of the windows at night that
presented a brilliant and captivating view from the plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>below. We found the ascent of the steep and narrow winding
way very fatiguing, which rendered a rest quite acceptable
upon reaching the summit, and it was well calculated
to recall the resting-place of the dove, from which this is
named.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though it was Sunday morning, and though the service
was for the church, several negroes were employed in carrying
baskets of brick upon their heads, from the base to
the top of this mountain, and moved up without any great
inconvenience under their heavy burdens. How they undergo
such labor with such weights upon their heads is a
mystery to me, but it seems to be the favorite mode of
transportation by the negroes here and at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these darkies, however, are strong in proportion to the
aroma of their persons, they ought to accomplish wonders,
for the scent was overpowering as they passed us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether joined me to-day at dinner
with Mr. Wright, and concurred in my very favorable
estimate of his accomplished and modest wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was ascertained to-day from Senor Urcezina Antonio
Ferreira that arrangements would be effected for us to leave
here to-morrow morning in company with him, to make the
voyage to Conceicão. But from the various modifications
of the plan and the changes of time for leaving, I feel considerable
misgivings about setting out with this man, and
have requested Mr. Wright to let Mr. Clinton W. Jackson,
the book-keeper in his store, accompany us on this trip as
interpreter. He has consented to this, and upon returning
to the hotel with a view to a final understanding, our escort
not meeting us at the hour fixed, Clinton was under the
necessity of going in search of him. He brought him round
in a short time, with an explanation of the delay, and we
were told that every thing was arranged for us to leave at
five o’clock next morning in a diligence to proceed to São
Vincente. This is a distance of eight miles, and thence
other means are provided.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Being impressed here with the difficulty of procuring
means of transportation, I telegraphed Senor Street, and
wrote a note to Mr. Bennaton to arrange animals for proceeding
on the 9th instant from São Paulo.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Monday</span>, <i>December 4, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>We made an early start from Santos in the diligence,
accompanied by Senor Ferreira, and reached São Vincente
in good time for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here was the first settlement of civilized man in this
region, Martin Affonso having landed at the port near by,
in 1532, and as a preliminary step erected a fort to protect
his people from the Indians who then held possession of
the country. There were various tribes of Indians throughout
the country, and through the intervention of João
Ramalho, a Portuguese who had been left upon this coast
by a vessel early in that century, a portion of these tribes
became friendly to the newcomers, and the town of São
Vincente was established. A church and a school soon
sprung up here, and there was a prospect of an increasing
population by accessions from the mother country. But
the hostile tribes of Indians made frequent incursions, in
which great outrages were committed, and the sense of insecurity
prevented any material advancement in the place.
The obstruction of the harbor ultimately by sand prevented
the entrance of vessels, and the present site of Santos became
the port, and business was transferred to that place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villa of São Vincente has perhaps been stationary
for over a hundred years as regards population; and it
seems to be the residence of a lazy, listless gang of very
ordinary people. There is a large church and a number of
houses, perhaps in all, fifty, which form one short street.
The inn at which we got breakfast and a few shops do all
the business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking our carpet-bags in our hands we set out at 8
o’clock for the canoe-landing, and crossed the Bertioga to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the main land in about half an hour. Again we proceeded
on foot, with a rain falling that drenched us thoroughly;
and the ground being flat was soon covered everywhere
with water, so that walking was attended with much difficulty.
It was expected that a walk of three miles would
take us to the beach, where a cart was to be in waiting.
But not finding any conveyance it became necessary to
travel on foot four miles farther. Here, however, we had
the firm sandy beach, and apart from the rain, the operation
of walking was not disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the covered cart or diligence of this Senor
Ferreira was reached; and all hands being in good keeping
for a lunch, the eatables provided for us at Santos were
drawn forth. With a cup of hot coffee prepared by the
inmates of the house where we stopped, and the bread
stuffed with sausages, all were refreshed for the progress in
the cart. This turnout for the transportation of persons
along the beach is quite a novelty, both in mode of construction
and in its being recently built for this express
line. The wheels are made of hard wood and have no iron
tire; but the axles are of iron, and the mechanism by
which the front connects with the body is quite too complicated
for description. The body is panelled, with seats
extending along each side within, after the omnibus style.
The cover is of cotton cloth which has been smeared with
oil, but not serving to exclude water, as we had ample opportunity
to testify. The three mules moved off at a fair
gait under the frequent lashings of our German postilion;
but after travelling eight or ten miles they became very
dull, and their pace was so much slackened, notwithstanding
the German’s antidote, that the progress was suspended
for the jaded animals to recuperate their energies.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time Major Meriwether and I proceeded on
foot, so as to relieve the mules of our weight when they
might resume the advance. It was raining some and blowing
considerably, but fortunately the wind came upon our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>backs so as to assist our progress. Any one who has ever
been upon a sea-beach with a strong wind can fully appreciate
the importance of having it to favor your course. With this
firm level beach and a very light vehicle, with sails attached,
it would have been quite practicable to keep ahead of these
slow movers. Indeed the idea of a windmill attached to
the wheels of a car upon a railway might be made available
for running even against the wind. The cogs upon a
trunnel head might be so adjusted as to work upon the cogs
on the axles, giving them progressive motion; though the
wheel of revolution by the wind should be turned to front
or rear or to either side. If this suggestion could be applied
to the stern-wheel of a small propeller, might it not
be used to advantage in some circumstances? We know
that windmills are used to draw water, and why not for
turning a wheel in water in like manner?</p>

<p class='c007'>This thought is original and perhaps novel; though it
may have very little practical merit, let some one try the
experiment and report the result, as the outlay for materials
will be but small.</p>

<p class='c007'>After walking four or five miles we found upon the
shore a boat-shelter with a thatched roof, under which lay
a large canoe. As this afforded some protection from the
rain and wind, it was thought best to stop here and rest a
while. A mulatto resident of the coast passed by our resting-place
and said it was but two leagues (eight miles) farther
to the village; but feeling inclined now to avail
ourselves of the cart, we were not in a hurry to move forward.
Major Meriwether observed a mulatto girl at some
distance indulging her curiosity by looking at us, and supposing
there must be a residence near at hand I rose and
started towards her, when she left precipitately at a full
run. Upon proceeding in the direction of her retreat I
came upon the house or rather the shelter where the family
resided, and asked for oranges and bananas, but was told
that none were to be had in these parts. The only thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>seen about the premises that could afford subsistence was
a few stalks of mandioca; and the interior of the establishment
displayed a meagreness of every thing that could
contribute to comfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>I learn that these people living along the coast depend
chiefly upon fish for a living, and consequently they don’t
trouble themselves much in cultivating the earth. Such
things as are produced spontaneously or with little labor
afford a scanty addition to their supplies from the water,
and they care for nothing beside. One of these fellows
had been engaged to carry our luggage before reaching the
station where we took the cart, and he seemed nimble on
the foot, with sufficient endurance, but this job would doubtless
satisfy him for a week.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being rested we set out afoot again, leaving a notice upon
the sand, “We proceed,” and after walking two miles further,
the cart was seen far to the rear. Not intending to
concede that we were particularly anxious to ride, the march
was continued until overtaken, which took us at least one
mile more on our way. Thus we travelled on foot not less
than fourteen or fifteen miles, and as the Major carried a
considerable quantity of fat, with new boots that did not
yield to the pressure, his feet were very much excoriated,
or, as I put it, he had gum-boils on his heels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mules still made very slow progress, and it began to
be a matter of concern whether they would take us to our
destination; but a while after dark our escort announced
that we were approaching the place, with the suggestion
that a portion of the party should get out, and thus lighten
the load through the heavy sand after leaving the beach.
Upon halting opposite the store of our companion, several
rockets illumined the dark regions above us, and reverberated
in the stillness of this retired settlement, to signalize
our arrival at Conceicão. After considerable delay we were
shown to a house having nothing but bedsteads to cheer
our vision, and told to make ourselves at home. A bottle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of gin was the only relief to the wet, cold and hungry travellers,
and as none of us had any particular fondness for
this beverage, it was touched very lightly. I did not hesitate
to ask for a fire, nor did I scruple subsequently to urge
a more ample supply of fuel. But it was built upon an
elevated scaffold, in a small room without a chimney, so
that it was difficult to get any of the warmth of the fire, and
the smoke pervaded every corner of the apartment, so that
it was almost intolerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>After so long a time we were served with coffee, and the
remnants of our day’s lunch, which seemed to indicate that
the resources of our chaperon were rather slim. But we
were still further impressed with this fact when their flagmats
and a single spread upon the hard boards of the bedsteads
were provided for our lodging. We certainly had
bed and board combined in this establishment, and a harder
lot I never encountered in all my rough-and-tumble progress
through the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>A servant was directed to report to us for supplying any
wants we might make known, but we were so nearly in
want of every thing that it would have been an endless undertaking
to have specified those things requisite for our
comfort, so we determined that whatever a night may bring
forth will be seen with the light of another day, and waited
for something to turn up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reception afforded here by Senor Urcezina Antonio
Ferreira differs so entirely from the good cheer of a Brazilian
welcome, such as I have been accustomed to receive
during my tour in the interior, that I have thought it proper
to make a record of the details as an exception to the usual
hospitable treatment extended to me by the people of this
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>This man is not without means, and though he has a
family residence in the villa, this unoccupied house has been
set apart for our accommodation, that we might not be disturbed
by the children, who are represented as dirty little
brats.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span><span class='sc'>Tuesday</span>, <i>December 5, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>I had resolved and re-resolved as I turned from side to
side upon my hard support for the night, that upon the first
indications of light I would assume the erect position, and
my companion in affliction, Dr. Shaw, complained aloud
most bitterly, insisting that he could not remain in this
position until daylight. Our neighbors, Major Meriwether
and Mr. Jackson, who bunked together, murmured in like
manner audibly of their hard lot. After all of us had
risen and dressed, a servant came to inform us that in the
first place coffee would be prepared for us, and within two
or three hours breakfast might be expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these circumstances I proposed a visit to the convent
which stands out in bold relief upon an elevated hill.
As the morning was cloudy our view was circumscribed,
but sufficient to show that the plain of low land upon which
Conceicão stands extends to a considerable distance, and
is limited by the serra on all sides excepting next to the
ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old building gives indications of decay in many parts,
while in others repairs are progressing to fit it for the approaching
festa on the 8th instant. This festival is superintended
by Colonel Albuquerque, of Santos, who has been
elected as the Festeiro, and will have to expend over a
thousand dollars in the preparations for this huge folly.</p>

<p class='c007'>We next called upon the Roman Catholic priest of this
place, with a letter of introduction from the vicar at Santos.
He was found in an uninviting apartment, and received us
with that dry courtesy which makes one feel that it is better
to go away as soon as civility will permit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having disposed of a very substantial breakfast, we
waited until 12 o’clock for the tide to assist us in ascending
the Rio Conceicão, and set out with Senor Ferreira in a
canoe, made after the style of the Mississippi dug-out.
With a supply of farina and boiled jerked-beef to meet our
wants for subsistence, and some matting to keep us from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>contact with ground at night, as well as to set upon in the
canoe, we were propelled by three able-bodied mulattoes,
who used the paddles as if they were trained to this service
upon the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon embarking, we observed that the mouth of the
river was very shallow, but we were told by Senor Ferreira
that at high tide a small schooner could enter, and that he
had a vessel which came in to load and unload. There is a
narrow neck of land separating the river from the ocean,
through which an artificial channel might be opened without
a great deal of labor, giving a much better entrance than
across the present rocky bar of the outlet to the sea.
Should the resources of the country warrant this proceeding,
it looks as if it would be entirely practicable. After
passing the bar the river is deep, and well adapted to navigation
for eight or ten miles, up to the mouth of the Rio
Prata, and thence the last-named is said to be navigable
for twelve miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main channel of the Rio Conceicão is not fitted for
navigation above the mouth of this river, and but for the
increase of water by the recent rains, our canoe could not
have ascended more than a few miles beyond this point.
Below, however, this river presents a fine body of water,
and is for the most part from ten to fifteen feet deep.</p>

<p class='c007'>After ascending about twelve miles it began to rain, and
going some three miles further we stopped for the night at
a rude shanty occupied by a woman and five children. One
son and one daughter were nearly grown, but the whole
presented a scene of slovenliness and abject misery which
made us realize that our lot was cast in even a worse place
than the night previous. But this time there was no alternative,
and we took it in the true spirit of wayfarers and
explorers.</p>

<p class='c007'>After eating pretty heartily of our cold victuals with hot
coffee, I indulged my curiosity by going into the end of the
house where the family were clustered around the small fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>upon the dirt floor, and saw in the imperturbable don’t-care
expression of the woman that no situation in life is so debased
but that it affords satisfaction. While that filthy
creature sat on the ground smoking her pipe, with a few
small fish in a pan and a little sour and stinking farina in
another vessel as the only provision for the wants of her
household, she doubtless had less concern for the future than
many who are surrounded by the comforts of life. The idleness
and the niggardliness of this class of people here<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a> presents
a most despicable view of life, and the worst feature
of all is, that they seem entirely reconciled to this mode of
living. I felt a constant apprehension of vermin while in
this shanty, and my only consolation was, that “life as it
is” could be seen and studied in a phase that was not often
presented for my observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we were ready for sleep sundry doors and benches
were brought into use for spreading our mats; and, Dr. Shaw
taking a place with me, the irregularities of the door proved
worse than last night.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Wednesday</span>, <i>December 6, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>After a night long to be remembered in the annals of
rancho lodging, we were glad to make an early rise, and all
sung out with one accord, let us go away, “vamos embora!
vamos embora!” Our escort insisted that we should remain
until some coffee was prepared, and a pigeon, shot by
Major Meriwether on yesterday, being boiled at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>time, we enjoyed a taste of it with some crackers, which constituted
a very dainty repast.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time one of the boys of the family was presented
to Dr. Shaw for prescription, and viewing his state
as the result of the impoverished state of the blood, he directed
that some vinegar should be put into a bottle with
nails, and that he take fifteen drops of this fluid three times
a day. In the absence of other remedies this was a good
expedient, and could not perhaps be improved if the whole
materia medica were at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The older son, who was nearly grown, hoping for some
improvement of his sanguiferous system, also applied to the
Doctor for the exercise of his skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>On bringing him up Mr. Jackson, who was acting as interpreter,
suggested, that as the other was to take the vinegar,
this fellow might perhaps derive benefit from taking the
nails, and he urged this more especially as he was complaining
of a stiff neck, that might be modified by swallowing a
few of these large iron spikes. The Doctor, however,
thought that a double dose of the vinegar would suffice,
with the use of a plunge bath and good scrubbing every
morning. This latter clause might have been recommended
as a prophylactic to the whole family, with the free use of
soap, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Getting into our dug-out the expedition was continued
up the river, and, after ascending five or six miles, the
stream became shallow and very swift in its course from the
serra, which was now very near. Our canoe was stopped
at a flat, broad sandy beach, having large pebbles intermixed
with stones at one extremity, and we availed ourselves
of the latter to erect a small monument to the folly
of the personage who accompanied us on this voyage. He
had, in compliance with our request to see the lands suited
for agricultural purposes, transported us upon water to a
point from which there was no egress, even on foot, and, in
the mean time, he was industriously occupied in delineating
upon the sand the course of the river, and its tributaries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>with the crests of the serras intervening, by which he undertook
to illustrate the desirableness of the lands for the
settlement of our people. After concluding his comments
upon this sketch he manifested great anxiety to know how
we were pleased with the country. To this I returned the
rather equivocal answer, that all were satisfied with his
drawing and explanations, and were ready to return in the
canoe to Conceicão.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our descent of the river we stopped at one of the four
settlements on the margin, and a woman in great trepidation
commenced hallooing, in a tremulous voice, João!
João! Efforts were made to quiet her fears by Senor Ferreira,
and to convince her that our mission was one entirely
of a pacific nature, but she did not seem satisfied until the
man João came to the house, and then another girl came
out also to see the curious strangers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here was seen perhaps one of the best samples of the
lands of this section, it being immediately at the foot of the
serra, and thus receiving the deposits of decayed vegetable
matter and portions of soil that are washed from its sides
by the rains. Vegetation was quite vigorous, and the
ground that was intended for the growth of a crop was preoccupied
to a great extent with weeds and shrubbery, indicating
a good soil, but a want of industry and a want of
the proper information for its cultivation. We were shown
a specimen of the sugar-cane growing in the midst of rubbish
from the fallen timber, and choked by a growth of
grass which still showed the adaptation for this crop, and
all were of the impression that, with judicious management,
the cane would yield profitably in this land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other articles which were planted, corn, beans, and
sweet potatoes, were growing under great disadvantages,
but gave signs of sufficient fertility in the soil to warrant
better results. Upon inquiry as to the growth of cotton,
we were shown two stalks that had sprung up among the
brush, which gave very little promise of a yield, and no inference
could be drawn from such a specimen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Some coffee trees of three years growth were seen upon
this ground, but their appearance was unfavorable, and it is
most likely this crop would prove unprofitable in this sea-coast
region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soil of the serra being mixed with that of the flat
land in this particular locality, gives better results than
could be obtained from either taken separately, and it would
doubtless make a good return for labor bestowed in transferring
soil from these slopes to the damp flat land below.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is due to the man João and his two sisters, to state
that they were neat and clean in their dress, and presented
rather more of a genteel appearance than is seen among the
lower class of people in this country. With their decent
bearing, it was a matter of surprise that no more skill or
industry was manifested in the culture of the small piece
of land which was planted.</p>

<p class='c007'>We got one of these women to prepare coffee for us, and
with the remnant of our cold victuals made a very respectable
breakfast. Some of the party had partaken so freely
of sugar-cane, that it became a subject of discussion as to
the bill for damages that might be brought against the consumers
of the products of this man’s farm.</p>

<p class='c007'>After descending two miles further, we stopped at a farm
of Senor Ferreira, where there is a building for a residence,
including the machinery for a rice-mill. Here we saw corn
growing tolerably well, and also rice and sugar-cane of fair
quality; but the cultivation of the land showed but little
more care than at the other place. It is evident that this
property, which he desires to sell, has induced him to confine
his arrangements to an examination of the few points
worthy of notice along this river. But we saw enough
here to convince us that the country is not adapted to our
purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Jackson bought at this house two otter skins for fifty
cents each, the boy declining to take the price until we got
some distance from the house, when he came running after
us with the skins, asking for the money.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>In going down the river several shots were fired with
pistols at water-birds, a ligarto, &#38;c., but there was no execution
done by any of the party.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one point on the margin of the river we saw several
parties preparing to embark in canoes, with stores of various
kinds, intended to serve them in visiting the villa during
the approaching festival.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following after us were two canoes, in each of which a
woman was assisting to paddle while standing up, and
seemed to be accustomed to this kind of service. Already
a number of people from the surrounding country have
arrived with their supplies, bringing even their fuel in the
canoes, and they live in freedom from all restraint, after
camp style, during their sojourn at the place. These festas
are religious ceremonies, without much show of solemnity,
in which mass is said, and is followed by sky-rockets and
fire-works of various kinds. Then comes the banquet by
the festeiro, and such other festivities as the occasion may
suggest, or the people desire for recreation.</p>

<p class='c007'>After reaching the landing at Conceicão we assisted in
drawing the huge canoe from the water upon rollers of
wood, and thus taking it upon the beach beyond the ordinary
rise of the water. Here lay quite a number of similar
vessels of these people awaiting their further movements
upon the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>We brought down with us a supply of the palmetto,
which is prepared by stripping off the outer layer, until the
central tender and white stem alone remains. This is then
chipped off from the end by a knife, and boiled or stewed
with a little fresh meat, and seasoned with pepper and salt,
making one of the best vegetables I have eaten in Brazil.
The portion used is about a yard long, presenting a green
exterior, and found at the top of the trunk of the palmetto,
(a species of palm,) with the leaves spreading out at its
upper extremity. There are the sweet and bitter, of which
the latter is particularly good for the stomach.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>December 7, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>It being understood that the cart was to be ready for us
to start upon our return at six o’clock this morning, we
rose and got a cup of coffee shortly after five o’clock a. m.
But, on repairing to the cart, it was found that the mules
were not even caught from the open common in which they
had been grazing, and that it would be necessary to find
them before they could be harnessed for the trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Senor Ferreira did not make his appearance, we sent
a messenger for him, and in the mean time, the head
man of the trio who paddled the canoe up the river presented
his account. He was informed that this would be
settled, with any other claims which might be rendered,
through Senor Urcezino Antonio Ferreira, for services received
by our party during this trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time, we had no means of knowing our true
relations to this personage, and were doubtful whether to
consider ourselves the guests of a gentleman who had taken
charge of us at the request of his friend the vicar at Santos,
or were to regard this man as simply a business agent to
procure what might be required on our account.</p>

<p class='c007'>This question was summarily solved by the presentation
of an account, by him, for all accommodations afforded us,
as follows:</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>In addition to this, the servants at the house were paid
two dollars and fifty cents for their attention; and thus it
is hoped and believed that all obligations are cancelled to
this Senor Urcezino Antonio Ferreira, of Conceicão.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is proper to remark, that the cart and mules used for
our transportation on the beach were the property of this
individual, and that the turn out was kept for the purpose
of making money out of the passengers on this route along
the beach.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Albuquerque, having arrived during the night,
called to see us while awaiting the slow movements of our
postilion; and I was pleased to find that he spoke some
English, as did each of his three sons, who had gone a voyage
on the Onward, with Captain Clark, who married their
sister. The Colonel, thinking of our needs during the day,
sent us a box containing a chicken, some Dutch cheese,
biscuits, grapes, and a bottle of excellent port wine, which
afforded a good repast on the beach. Though our acquaintance
was slight, and he was merely sojourning here temporarily
with his family, yet he extended that consideration to
us which has characterized the bearing of all Brazilian gentlemen
heretofore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Catholic priest had called to see us at our quarters,
and gave us a passing call this morning, when proceeding
on some professional duty in the vicinity of our rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a large church besides the convent in this place.
The buildings are chiefly in one straight row, and a few for
a short distance on the opposite side, with a sorry and woe-be-gone
population not exceeding twenty-five or thirty families,
doing but little business.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mules being at length in readiness we made a start
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>with a team of four at 9 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, but only proceeded a
short distance when the double-tree in front was broken,
and it became necessary to proceed with but three mules.
On reaching the beach the lead mule became unmanageable
and ran into the sea, taking the others and cart so far that
upon the return of the waves from the tide we were likely
to go afloat, thus facilitating our transportation rather more
than was desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>This trouble was corrected for the future by placing a
man, who accompanied the driver, astride of the front mule,
but the great difficulty of slow movement was not so easily
overcome, though he was supplied with a pair of our spurs,
and both these drivers plied the rod most vigorously upon
the animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>I counted the number of blows inflicted upon one of these
beasts within five minutes at two different periods, and they
averaged ten to the minute; which for five hours, the term
of the trip, would make the round sum of three thousand
lashes received by this mule.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our postilions were German sailors and both spoke some
English, so that we could communicate with them. After
an interruption in our voyage by some derangement of the
rigging, they both got into position for advancing, and Alberta
Deyer, who was on the driver’s seat, called out to
Lewis Thompson, who rode the front mule, “Now take your
course south by half west, and make sail—vamos.” With
these two high-pressure oscillating engines we made about
three knots an hour; and for a time all of us were quite
amused at the extraordinary proceedings of these fellows,
but eventually it became a most serious matter, and nothing
could urge our lazy and jaded beasts out of a walk. I remonstrated
with the drivers not to inflict further punishment
upon the animals, as the blood was already to be seen
in various parts, not only from the spurs but from the heavy
blows of the poles used by these athletic sons of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length we reached the point where the road turns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>from the beach, and it was questionable whether the mules
could go any further; but it continued to rain, and it was
desirable to remain under cover as long as any progress
could be made in the cart.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had gone however a very short distance when some
mismanagement of our helmsman brought the wheels on one
side almost into a very deep ditch, and the mule next to the
ditch, with the instinct of self-preservation, which is characteristic
of that animal, leaped with its fore feet over the
tongue. There was imminent danger of being upset, and
all hurried out, with our baggage in our hands, determined
to proceed on foot. A bottle of rum had been got on the
way, to counteract the soaking rain upon the drivers, and
giving them another drink they were left to exercise their
sailors’ ingenuity to avert shipwreck of their craft.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking nearly three miles we crossed the Bertioga again
in a canoe, and upon reaching São Vincente<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a> hired horses
for one dollar and a half each, to ride eight miles, into
Santos. It was very dark, and some of the road very
rough, but all got through safely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether stopped at the hotel,
while I assisted Mr. Jackson in taking the horses to a pasture
at Mr. Wright’s; and getting supper we congratulated
ourselves that the trip to Conceicão was ended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having spent the night with my friend Wright, I arose
early and went to the Hotel Milan, where my comrades
were quartered, finding Senor Street had returned from São
Paulo. My telegram was received by him, but he stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>that it would be impracticable for him to proceed through
the country, and that Mr. N. Bennaton had gone to Rio de
Janeiro, with the expectation of returning on the 11th inst.
A letter was found here from him, proposing that we
wait until he could join us, to make the tour from São
Paulo through the country. But in view of all the facts
we concluded to avail ourselves of the boat expected daily
to proceed to Cananea; and after examining the lands adjacent
to the Ribeira de Ignape, to return to this point,
and go thence to São Paulo, to make the trip to the country
lying between the Tieté river and the serra to the eastward.</p>

<p class='c007'>We made a reconnoissance this morning of a lot of land
in the city belonging to Commendador Ferreira, which he
proposes to sell. It extends from the water at the lime-factory,
in a solid oblong body, lying between two streets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The measurement made by stepping was five hundred
and fifty (550) yards in length and three hundred and
fifteen (315) yards in breadth; with a portion of irregular
shape not measured, extending to the water. For this it
is understood that his price is ten thousand (10,000) dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another portion of vacant land belonging to the
same gentleman located between that described and the
water street on the front of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>This measures four hundred (400) yards in length, two
hundred and thirty (230) yards wide at one end, and one
hundred (100) yards or thereabouts in width, at the other
end. The breadth corresponds very nearly to the greater
measurement through half of the lot, and then slopes to
that of the smaller, making it somewhat irregular in shape.
This has a water front with a street, which is bounded by
a rock wall as a barrier to the tide, and here is afforded
very desirable sites for building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should he be willing to include this with the sale of the
other, it would make a very valuable property for those
who may wish a city investment.</p>

<p class='c007'>That Santos will improve greatly in a few years is confidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>anticipated, and lands within the city limits, such
as these, must increase in value.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wright accompanied us in visiting the lime-factory
already mentioned as located at the edge of the water at
the northern portion of the city; in which the shells and
deposits of a calcareous nature from the island are worked
up into a beautiful white lime. There is a small steam-engine
for working the ventilating apparatus, which acts
upon the furnace, and the fuel being placed beneath the
mass of materials a heat is generated which transforms the
shell into the gray crude lime.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this process is completed, the mass is removed to
the open chamber of the building, and parcel by parcel is
sprinkled with water and placed in a pile, which developes
warmth so great that the hand cannot bear it, thus producing
the lime in ordinary use under the name of slacked
lime. It presents a fine aspect, with all the other indications
of a good quality of this article. There is no limestone
near this place, and hence the shell is made available
for lime.</p>

<p class='c007'>We also visited the tannery located in the suburbs of the
city near the margin of the coast on the north. It is by
no means so neat as the one described in Rio de Janeiro,
and the want of any systematic disposition of the refuse
parts of the hides leaves them to create a stench about
the place which attracts a number of buzzards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The articles used chiefly for astringents in the tanning
process are the same as observed in Rio; the leaf and
bark of the manque manse and the manque bravo, which grow
promiscuously over the extensive tidewater lowlands near
this city. There is in connection with this tannery a rude
lime-factory, which produces from the burning of shell the
lime required for use at this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>In examining the specimens of sole leather that were
piled up under an open shed, the process of tanning seemed
to be very thorough; and though there is not that care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>and attention bestowed which would insure the best results,
yet this business has proved profitable to the proprietor.
He has a small steamboat which is used for bringing
in his materials for tanning, his raw-hides from the
city, and in delivering his leather for shipment, or any other
service connected with his operations. This diminutive
craft makes regular trips also to Cubitão, connecting with
the diligence line to São Paulo; and is frequently hired for
excursions, thus making a nice little income, besides serving
all the purposes of transportation for the tannery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wright tried to procure this small steamer for our
party to visit Perique to-morrow, but found that it was engaged,
and that it could not take us until Sunday.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether were invited by Mr.
Wright to dine at his house to-day, it being the birthday of
his elder son, Billy. His father-in-law, mother-in-law, and
sister-in-law were also present on the occasion; and we
were all favorably impressed and very much pleased with
the performance on the piano by Mrs. Wright and her sister.
Most of our Southern songs are played by Mrs. Wright,
but really there are so few of them in keeping with the result
of our struggle, that we feel but little interest in hearing
them now.</p>

<p class='c007'>In going out upon the street after dark with Mr. Wright,
we observed there were some exercises at the Roman
Catholic church; and upon entering, we found that a number
of persons, principally females, were kneeling for mass;
while vocal and instrumental music added interest to the
scene. It was a day of some festival.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we returned we met on the pavement at the entrance
of a house Senor Manoel Pinto Soares; and soon afterwards
his wife Donna Flora came down prepared for a
walk. As they were going in the same direction with us,
Mr. Wright devolved it upon me to escort the lady, and
upon going forward with her, Senor Manoel suggested that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>she take my arm, whereupon I tendered her this assistance,
which was accepted by her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though I could command but a meagre supply of the
Portuguese language for conversation, I arranged my words
so as to be understood, and her remarks were also comprehended,
so that there was but little embarrassment. My
observation has now satisfied me that ladies in refined
society receive the same kind of attention from gentlemen
as is customary with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether spent the night with
me at Mr. Wright’s, and a cup of coffee being served to us
very early we set out before 6 o’clock to the canoe of Senor
Antonio Franco in company with Senor Street, for a trip
across the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wright’s double-barrelled fine English gun was taken
along by the Major, and he had an opportunity of shooting
at an alligator, (jacaré,) but it made its escape into the
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon approaching the site of Senor Bastos, the canoe
entered a sort of canal leading up into the land, and we
then disembarked and walked a few hundred yards over a
level, low, marshy plain to the house. Rice was seen upon
one side presenting a healthy aspect; while on the other
was a garden-spot that has received more than the usual
attention, yet the vegetables did not look flourishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vegetables do not usually grow well with us in any kind
of soil without some artificial stimulus; and the art of
manuring is almost unknown to these people, so that it is
rare to see good vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sugar-cane was also growing at a short distance
from our path, but is a small variety with short joints,
having a red or purple aspect, that is cultivated only for
cachaça, (rum.) I infer from the specimen seen that the
land has not the requisite fertility to produce the best cane.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>The house upon this place is a large one-story building,
having the rice and sugar apparatus under the same roof,
worked by water-power. Most of the territory is mountainous
and of little fertility; but the flat lands with proper
management might be rendered productive and profitable.</p>

<p class='c007'>I acquiesced in the arrangement for taking a voyage in
the steamer to-day, though it was the Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c007'>We visited the extensive establishment known here as
Perique, in company with the proprietor, Senor Valencia,
some twenty miles distant from the city of Santos.</p>

<p class='c007'>The houses and grounds have been recently overhauled
and renovated, presenting an attractive combination of
extensive buildings, with a beautiful beach and delightful
sea-breeze. The dwelling has eighteen rooms, besides a
large dining-saloon and ample corridors, presenting an air
of comfort that is rarely met with anywhere. There are
also outhouses suited for the quarters of laborers and for
all other purposes required on a fazenda.</p>

<p class='c007'>We saw a portion of the land that would be well adapted
to the cultivation of any of the staples, but this was not
of large extent; and a great portion of it is low and
marshy, so as not to suit any thing but rice. The entire
territory is represented as containing sixteen square miles,
and I should not think that more than two square miles is
sufficiently fertile to repay for cultivation, a part being
unfitted for use by reason of the serras and a part by the
marsh.</p>

<p class='c007'>This place and its present proprietor have been rendered
somewhat famous by a hostile collision on his part with the
English marines under Captain Croft, in 1850; who landed
here under orders to suppress the slave-trade conducted
through this port of entry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Valencia collected thirty-seven negroes and thirteen
whites, with guns, and after being fired upon, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>poured a volley into the ranks of the marines, which caused
them to return to their vessel. He states that this body
of troops had previously gone to another improved place
on this land and burned several houses; and that he supposed
it to be their purpose to burn these large buildings
on the beach. He determined to resist their further destruction
of his property, and secreting this force on the
route by which he supposed the marines would approach
the house, an elevated position was taken by him where
he could watch their movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was understood by his men that, upon a signal from
him with a cow-horn, they were to use their weapons against
the invaders. As the marines approached their position,
one of the negroes becoming curious to see what was going
on, rose up to look and was immediately shot in the head
by the marines; whereupon, a blast from the horn induced
them to return the fire promptly and with effect. One man
was known to have been killed, and the signs of blood upon
the spot and along the line of retreat gave evidence of the
fire of his domestic guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Valencia was subsequently demanded by the English
government, and had to leave the country to avoid
capture. He has spent most of the time since in Montevideo,
until his interests there being ruined by the operations
of the war with Paraguay, induced him to apply to
the Emperor of Brazil for permission to return. He came
back in June of this year, finding every thing about this
place in disorder, and has endeavored to bring it again in
workings condition with a view to dispose of it. It affords
fine facilities for fishing, and might be made profitable in
supplying the Santos market.</p>

<p class='c007'>We visited the factory of brick and tile on the main land
beyond the bay, two miles distant from the city. It is the
most complete, in all appliances, which I have seen anywhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>having a steam-engine to work up the mortar preparatory
to moulding, and having a patent compressing
apparatus that gives a neat smooth surface to the brick
while it imparts solidity and firmness to the entire mass.
The furnaces are constructed of stone and faced with fireproof
brick, having a general finish which is rarely seen in
such establishments.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was particularly impressed with the simplicity of the
tile-making. The mortar was first spread upon a flat board
by the hand of a stout negro fellow, and then another
passed a scraper over this, to remove the superfluous layer,
when a third turned it upon the convex mould which gives
it the proper shape, and bears it to a shelf, upon which it
remains until sufficiently dry to be put into the furnace for
the action of the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the above-named articles there are also
manufactured here various household wares, such as water
tanks, or jars of very large size for keeping in public or
private houses, earthen bottles shaped like demijohns, bowls,
stew-pans, and which are used in place of metal vessels
very generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The material used is a combination of the clay taken from
the hillside with the mud of the low land, and while neither
separately would be well adapted to the purpose, this mixture
makes an excellent mortar for moulding and burning.
There is not a large quantity of brick or tile on hand, but
some of all the varieties of style and size, showing the
capacity of the establishment to meet any demand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon inquiring the price of the brick I was told that for
the smaller size, nine inches by three inches, the cost was
twenty-five dollars per thousand; for the larger, twelve inches
by four inches, thirty dollars per thousand; and for flooring
brick ten inches square, fifty dollars per thousand. The
last-named is a broad, square, thin tile brick with a figure
impressed upon it, which is decorative in fitting up the basement
of houses or paving fancy walks in a yard or open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>court. It is not very likely that the above prices will encourage
the builders of houses to change from their old
style of mud walls; and really if some of our people, who
know how to manufacture brick upon an economical scale,
would come here and enter largely into the business, it must
prove very profitable to them, while it would be a great advantage
to those erecting houses in Santos.</p>

<p class='c007'>The compressing machines are of English make, under
the patent of Clayton &#38; Co., and are worked by hand. The
steam-engine for working up the mortar is from the works
of Maler &#38; Co., located at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a canal connecting the factory with the bay
which greatly facilitates transportation. A tank or well in
the yard under shelter affords a supply of water for mixing
the mortar, while there is a fountain of pure and cool water
coming from the mountain side through a pipe into a large
marble receiver in the open air.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Buhlaw arrived in the city to-day from Cananea,
and represents the lands of superior quality, while the
transportation by water is available on all sides of the territory.
He states that the soil is dark and the trees are
large, without much undergrowth of shrubbery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the arrival of the Santa Maria from Rio de Janeiro
I went aboard with Captain Balbi, who invited me to take
a seat in his boat, and found Mr. Bennaton there with instructions
from the Minister of Agriculture to accompany
us on our tour from São Paulo across the country. He
stated that he could go now, and might not be able to accompany
us if we delayed to make the trip to Cananea by
water. I asked him if he thought it would be practicable to
reach the country lying upon the tributaries of the Ribeira
de Ignape and belonging to Cananea by going across from
São Paulo upon mules; when he gave it as his opinion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>we could make the trip, and said that he would advise us
to adopt that course.</p>

<p class='c007'>As this concurred with the view I had when the telegram
was sent to Senor Street at São Paulo, and the boat upon
which we expected to proceed might be still further delayed,
I advised Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether that it would be
better to pursue the course above indicated. It was accordingly
arranged that Mr. Bennaton would go on to São
Paulo to-day and that we should go to-morrow, it being
understood with Senor Street that we would meet him at
Xiririca, on the Ribeira de Ignape, so that he might assist
us in the examination of the country. As Senor Street had
already gone to the trouble to arrange for our visit by
steamer, he was not satisfied that we should abandon that
plan, but with the advice of Mr. Bennaton in favor of the
other course, it was adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our baggage was sent by the transportation wagon of
the diligence line forthwith, and we were notified that seats
would be provided for us on a train of cars going out this
afternoon to Moije station, where the cars stop for the
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Henderson, the gentlemanly superintendent, gave us
a pass over the road free of charge, and we were informed
that the same would be extended on returning. We found
a number of officials connected with the road on the train
with us; also my friend, Mr. D. H. Sampson, and the Rev.
A. G. Simonton, brother-in-law of Rev. A. L. Blackford.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a ride of twelve miles we stopped at a public house
kept by a German, who gave us an excellent dinner, with
all the varieties of drinks usual in the city hotels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beds were spread upon the floor for the accommodation
of our party, and we found every thing very comfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>We found here upon arrival Senor Martino, with a friend
connected with the law school in São Paulo. They had
come down with their guns and dogs, expecting to have a
hunt in this vicinity; but it has been raining so constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>as to prevent the sport. Both of these gentlemen have
been students of law for more than the usual term, but
their fondness for the woods with their dogs and guns has
taken more of their attention than their books. Senor
Martino has now, however, graduated, and has consequently
the title of Dom, as every one here has who is permitted to
practise law. He has promised to send me a supply of
indigo seed from Minas, where he resides and this plant is
grown extensively.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After breakfasting some of our party repaired to the
clear, cold stream, where a dam had been thrown up, and
enjoyed a plunge bath, which was quite bracing and
salutary.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were conveyed from the station to the foot of the
serra in a light open car, by a horse. We went in a rapid
trot over the smooth parts of the road, but suddenly we
were notified that the engine was meeting us, when our
trella was stopped, and the horse disengaged so as to run
it back and avoid a collision. The engine, however, stopped
before reaching us, and we proceeded to the workshop on
foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire party were next carried up the steep grade on
the serra, of one foot ascent in every ten feet, for one mile
and a quarter, by the action of a stationary engine of one
hundred and sixty horse-power. We then walked a similar
distance, a land-slide having interrupted the running of the
inclined plane. Again we were drawn up the third section,
and walked up the fourth, where the track was torn away
by the sliding of the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much has been done here to overcome the natural difficulties
presented by this serra, but much more has yet to
be done before any reliance can be placed upon this line for
transportation of freight, or as a highway of travel for passengers.
Not only must the earth or stone upon which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>track rests be secured against yielding, but the sides of the
cuts in the serra must not be liable to slide, and thus endanger
the passage of trains, or obstruct the road at various
points.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a double track for one-half of the distance upon
each of the four inclined planes, and a balance car runs
down at one end of the huge wire cable, while the train is
drawn up at the other extremity.</p>

<p class='c007'>By sundry turns of this cable around the rims of large
metal wheels connected with the stationary engines, the
friction and resistance is such as to obviate slipping of the
wire cable. This entire force is brought to bear upon the
freighted train in its ascent, while the descending balance
car keeps the cable tight, and exerts some influence upon
the ascending train of cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>At each of the four stations one of these immense engines,
having five capacious and strong boilers, exerts its power
in bringing up the trains. But all this seems now very
much like the lever of Archimedes, with which he proposed
to move the world if he could but secure a fulcrum. The
basis of efficient operation for the road being the embankment
upon which the track rests, it is indispensable that
some plan shall be adopted to render it secure, or the tremendous
power of the machinery can be of no avail.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of our last walk we reached the level where
the locomotive is sufficient to move the train, and after a
lunch of cheese, bread and beer at a vende, (retail shop,)
we took our seats in an open car and whirled along at a
rapid rate over the road to São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of iron stools of a concavo-convex shape as supports
for the rail, instead of wooden cross-ties, is adopted
here, but an accident from the breaking of one leads to the
inference that they are unsafe.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was one point upon the track at which two cars,
loaded with dirt, discharged their cargo with remarkable
despatch, by dropping the sides, that were attached by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>hinges, and then the negroes used their shovels to conclude
the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had on the train with us Mr. J. J. Auburtin, the
general superintendent of the road; Mr. Henderson, superintendent
of the working operations; Mr. Fox, president
engineer; Mr. Hutchins, secretary to chief engineer; and
Mr. Jesters, traffic agent. All the business offices are in the
city of São Paulo, and the chief work-shops are located
there also. The chief engineer of the company resides in
England, and has his representative here looking after the
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon reaching the Hotel da Europa, we met Mr. Bennaton,
who informed us that arrangements were progressing
for our trip; but it is most likely we may be detained
several days, and we must practise that Brazilian virtue,
patience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Calling upon Mr. Blackford and lady during the evening,
I found their house filled with ministers of the gospel, who
are here with a view to organize a Presbytery, to exercise
discipline among those who have become members of the
Presbyterian church in this section, and to ordain a converted
Catholic priest, who has been assisting in missionary
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the people here profess to be tolerant of other religions,
some of the former enactments in regard to seats
in the councils of state, and in regard to marriage, are calculated
to discourage emigration, but it is expected that
these things may be changed ere long.</p>

<p class='c007'>The indications of delay here are evident, from all that
can be learned to-day, and we feel that suspense which is
natural to those earnestly desiring to accomplish an object.</p>

<p class='c007'>I accompanied Dr. Shaw and Major Meriwether to purchase
an outfit of water-proof overcoats and leggins, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>cost each of them twenty-two dollars and fifty cents, but
they are now well provided against the rainy season.</p>

<p class='c007'>This period of almost constant rain is now upon us, and
lasts usually two or three months in this latitude. During
the other nine months of the year, rain falls but seldom in
any considerable quantity, and during June, July, and
August, is regarded the dry season of the year. These
being the coolest months, the relations of the wet and dry
season to temperature differs from what is observed in the
United States. The winter with us is usually the period of
most rain; but there is not so marked a difference, as is
remarked in Brazil, between the rainy and dry seasons of
the year. I anticipate less inconvenience in travelling from
the rain than would be experienced from the continuous
hot sun during the day; and learning that the mornings
are for the most part free from rain, we can do most of our
riding early in the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>A most important item to the traveller is to have along
with him, at all times, a change of under-clothing, and for
this object, a water-proof valise or satchel is very convenient.
In this, his comb, tooth-brush, and a pair of slippers
can also be kept at hand, though he may be temporarily
separated from his baggage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bennaton now thinks that matters will be arranged
so that we can leave day after to-morrow, but while we do
not wish to retard any of the preparations, it is not expected
that we will leave until Monday. None of us
approve of travelling on the Sabbath, when it can be
avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Blackford called to see us this evening, and remonstrated
warmly against Sunday travelling, but more especially
against setting out on a business tour upon the
Sabbath, when we could so easily wait for another day.
He insisted that no good would come of business done on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the Sabbath, and said if we did not expect to observe the
sanctity of the Sabbath in this country, we had better
return at once to our families, as he felt assured they would
not prosper here, without keeping the Sabbath day holy to
the Lord, and observing it as a day of rest from labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meeting Dom Prates upon the street this afternoon, he
informed me that he has a body of land on the Ribeira de
Ignape, of which every alternate lot will be given to families
who will locate on them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having arranged to meet Dom Bernardo Gavião this
morning, we proceeded to his office, with Mr. Bennaton as
interpreter. Upon inquiring the terms upon which he
would dispose of the whole, or a part of the extensive territory
of Cambuy, he stated that he would take one hundred
and twenty-five thousand ($125,000) dollars for the entire
property. Estimating it at twelve square leagues, the cost
will be something over one ($1) dollar per acre, and believing
that there is not over four square leagues which is well
adapted to cultivation, it puts the price over three dollars
an acre for the productive land. He couples the proposition
with an offer to hire two hundred and forty negroes
for a series of years, at the annual rate of twelve thousand
five hundred ($12,500) dollars; the first payment to be
made at the end of the second year, and without interest,
but subsequent payments at the close of each year. He
informs us that there are one hundred and twenty men,
ninety women, and thirty children. It will be noted that
the proportion of men is large to that of the women, and
the proportion of children very small, which is to be
observed in most gangs of negroes in Brazil; the former
owing to larger importations of males from Africa, and the
latter from want of proper care of women and their offspring.
These negroes are to be fed, clothed, and receive
medical treatment, at the expense of the party employing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>them; while the owner loses the time of disability for
labor, by running away, or, in the event of death, a pro rata
reduction being made.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Friend</span>:—In satisfying your request for information
in regard to our missionary work in Brazil, I am compelled
to-day to be very brief.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August of 1859, the Rev. A. G. Simonton arrived in
Rio de Janeiro. In July of 1860, myself and wife arrived.
In May, 1861, Mr. Simonton began preaching in Portuguese
to three or four persons. The number of hearers slowly
increased the first year to twenty-five or thirty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December of 1861, the Rev. F. J. C. Schneider arrived
in Rio de Janeiro, destined to labor among the German
colonists of this province. He resides in Rio Claro, (São
João de,) and has devoted himself to this special work, amid
many discouragements, and seeing but little fruit as yet of
his labors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January of 1862, a church was organized in Rio de
Janeiro, when one American and one Portuguese were received
on profession, as the first fruits of our mission. Our
church there now numbers forty-nine members, nearly all
natives and Portuguese, and converts from Romanism.
Hundreds have heard the word of God preached. The
present average attendance is nearly one hundred, and
would doubtless be much larger, but from the difficulty of
getting a suitable hall for preaching. During most of the
years of 1861, ’62, ’63 and ’64, preaching was held in English
in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>In October of 1863, I came to São Paulo, to begin a new
station in this city. In March of the present year, 1865, we
organized a church here, receiving as our first fruits six
persons on profession, all natives, and Portuguese, and converts
from Romanism. The attendance here ranges from
fifteen to thirty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October of 1864, we received on profession to the
church in Rio de Janeiro, O. Senor José Manoel de Conceicão,
formerly a priest of the Roman Catholic church,
and vicar of Brotas in this province. He is a man of fine
talents, education, extensive information, and very eloquent.
We expect (D. V.) to ordain him on to-morrow, to the full
work of the gospel ministry. In his former parish of Brotas
a church was organized on the 13th November of the present
year, with eleven members, converts from Romanism. No
missionary resides there, and the work has been done so
far by visits from time to time of the persons above-named.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since 1855, a Scotch physician has been preaching in Rio
de Janeiro. The result is a church, with a membership of
more than one hundred, and an attendance of from two to
three hundred.</p>

<p class='c007'>About a dozen colporteurs are at work in Rio de Janeiro,
and in various parts of the empire, circulating the Bible
and other books.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some seven or eight German ministers are laboring among
their countrymen in various parts.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>A. L. Blackford</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am also informed that a Presbytery was organized yesterday,
by these three Presbyterian ministers, to be in
communication with the Synod of Baltimore. Senor Conceicão
having preached his trial sermon this morning, is to
be ordained this afternoon. It was delivered at the house
of Mr. Blackford, in the presence of a mixed auditory, of
which Dr. Shaw, Major Meriwether and myself formed a part.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>As he spoke Portuguese, I could only gather a few ideas,
and the others had to draw upon their imagination entirely;
but, like the deaf man in regard to William C. Preston, we
could say he made the motions well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afternoon. Since writing the above, I witnessed the
ordination of Senor José Manoel de Conceicão (formerly a
priest of the Roman Catholic church) as a minister of the
gospel in the Presbyterian faith, of the Protestant church.
He was interrogated by the Rev. A. L. Blackford, who was
joined by the Rev. A. G. Simonton, and the Rev. F. J. C.
Schneider, in the laying on of hands, while Senor Conceicão
kneeled in their midst. Mr Simonton then delivered an
address, at the close of which Senor Conceicão spoke with
deep feeling and the most humble appreciation of his new
relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>This event indicates an important epoch in the progress
of Protestantism in this papal land, and the character of the
individual, with his influence among the people, will doubtless
have considerable effect upon the public mind. He has
manifested much independence in separating himself from
the associations of Romanism; and his appearance bespeaks
the character of a high-toned, intelligent gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our trunks were packed and all our baggage arranged
for taking our departure early this morning; but it was
found that there were still wanting two pack-mules and a
pack-saddle to equip us for the tour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the proffer of Dr. Shaw to pay for the pack-saddle,
one was purchased by Mr. Bennaton, at the round figure of
thirty ($30.00) dollars. Our friend Mr. Sampson procured
two additional mules, and the outfit was pronounced complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>The President of the province having given Mr. Bennaton
the requisite document and funds for proceeding with us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>our party left the capital at half-past two o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, after
a detention of five days for preparation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. J. J. Auburtin, general superintendent of the Santos
and São Paulo railway, accompanies us on the tour as far
as Sorocaba, having his own servant, and also his own
riding mules. But it seems that he is supplied with a pack-mule
and pack-saddle by Mr. Bennaton, and hence the necessity
for another to be purchased.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two camaradas and a servant with us, and the
number of animals is fifteen, there being three pack-mules,
with five loose animals, besides those under the saddle, exclusive
of the two mules of Mr. Auburtin. Two or three of
the animals furnished by the government are not in good
condition, but those furnished by private parties are well
fitted for service, and we have much reason to be thankful
for the generosity of these gentlemen in supplying them for
our use.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have the good fortune to be mounted again upon Jack,
the mule which was furnished by Mr. Gephardt for my former
tour. He has now been purchased for the public service by
Mr. Bennaton, in view of a commission which has been intrusted
to him by the Minister of Agriculture, for a survey
of routes from Campinas to Itu, and to Araraquara, with
reference to the location of a railroad. After closing the
present expedition, he expects to enter upon that service.
This is a very important movement for the future prospects
of any of our people who may locate near these places, but
we cannot rely upon any thing definite being accomplished
speedily for the improvement of transportation in that direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon leaving I called at the residence of Mr. Blackford,
and got a Portuguese and English Testament for Dr. Shaw,
and, on offering to pay for it, he told me that payment
would be received in farina when business was commenced
in this country, or, in other words, it was a present.</p>

<p class='c007'>We halted for the night at the Ponte Cretia, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>establishment and the feminine tenant gave but little promise
of comfort. Corn, however, for our animals, and supper of
chicken and rice for ourselves, with tolerable beds, reconciled
us to the necessity of the situation. In driving the
animals to a pasture in the dark, a horse fell over a precipice
and was left for the night.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After getting a cup of coffee and having corn given to the
stock, we got off from Ponte Cretia at 7 o’clock this morning.
The horse being extricated from the ravine proved to
be but slightly injured, and all moved on towards Itu. A
number of trains of pack-mules were passed, laden with
cotton, some of the bales being marked three and a half
arrobas, (one hundred and twelve pounds,) while others
were marked three arrobas, (ninety-six pounds,) and larger
in bulk than those observed from other parts of this province.
These bales correspond very much to the bales of
Osnaburg, seen in South Carolina and Georgia, being, however,
a little longer and not so broad. They are enclosed
in bagging, with the sipo vine used instead of ropes.</p>

<p class='c007'>We met on the road Colonel Fortunato José de Camargo,
who resides near Faxina, and is engaged largely in raising
horses, mules and cattle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Auburtin informs me that he owns eighty (80) square
leagues of territory, being the largest landowner in the
province.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our weather-protectors were brought into requisition to-day
to keep off the shower of rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped early in the day at the fazenda of Senor Joaquim
José de Silva, some two miles from the main road,
where every thing needful was provided for us.</p>

<p class='c007'>We saw here a patch of tea-plants which had evidently
grown well, but was now neglected. The seed are round,
of the size of a small acorn, and three in each pod.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Cotton which had produced a crop last year was again
growing well, after being cut off near the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corn is also looking vigorous, and promises a good yield.
All this land is very steep and hilly.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After our horses and mules came from the pasture this
morning, it was observed that some of them had blood upon
their necks, caused from the bites of the bat, known as the
vampire, that not unfrequently attacks animals at night,
and fixes itself upon a vein of the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being supplied with an early breakfast, we took leave of
Senor Silva and his two good-looking daughters, who were
seen then for the first and only time during our visit. His
son went with us to the Freguezia Avasariquama, or
Piedede, avoiding the steep hills by which we had approached
on the day previous.</p>

<p class='c007'>One league beyond this place we reached the margin of
the Tieté, and proceeded along it by a very fair road fifteen
or sixteen miles, when we turned to the left, and reached
the city of Itu at 6 o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>This region of country is very irregular and even mountainous,
yet we found cane growing well, and also a good
prospect for corn and rice. The river is not suited for navigation,
and the settlements on both sides depend upon the
road we travelled for sending their products to market
by carts or pack-mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>We made a halt of three and a half hours during the heat
of the day at the inn of Verzinha, getting dinner and refreshing
our animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon reaching the town of Itu the urgent thirst of some
of the party was satisfied with beer, after which we repaired
to the elegant and extensive establishment of the Baron of
Perecicaba. I was sorry that his son, Antonio Paez de
Barros, had left home, as my acquaintance with him would
have enhanced the pleasure of the visit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>The old gentleman, however, received us with the greatest
cordiality, and tendered us any thing he could do or furnish
for our comfort. Leaving Mr. Auburtin to talk with the
baron, the rest of us strolled out to the extensive fruitery,
which is nearly a mile in length, and filled with a great
variety of trees and vines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best quality of pine apple, called Abacashi, is growing
here abundantly. Oranges, bananas, jaboticabas, pomegranates,
figs, peaches and apples all grow here advantageously.
There was a specimen of dwarf apple, spread over
the ground like a small shrub, in the spaces between the
other trees, and having a small, pleasant-tasted fruit.
Upon inquiry I learned that this is a peculiar variety, and
not the result of any special mode of culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grapes of various kinds were growing vigorously in different
parts of the grounds upon frames put up for the support
of the vines. We enjoyed a delicious treat of these
fine grapes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tea-plant was growing over a large area, and looks
flourishing, affording a good article for table use. This
shrub presents much the aspect of the boxwood tree, and
from two to four of the tender leaves from each branch are
picked off at each gathering of the crop.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coffee likewise has a place in this collection of trees, but
the soil has not that fertility which is requisite for a good
yield, and manure is employed to give vigor to its growth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The climate and soil of this region is regarded as particularly
adapted to the yield of fruits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supper was announced at 9½ o’clock, and was of the most
substantial order, with beer and wine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Auburtin brought out his own black tea by permission.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast the Baron joined us in a ride to the Salto
of the Rio Tieté, four miles distant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>This is an irregular water-fall, making quite a cascade at
one point of perhaps twenty feet. The entire fall of water
is about fifty feet, and the site is well suited for machinery
of any magnitude that may be desired. A large cotton factory
might be located here with a prospect of being supplied
with raw material from the country below; and much
of it could ascend the river in canoes or boats to the foot
of this fall. There has been a small mill here upon a site
that would warrant extensive works, with command of any
amount of water-power, and the investment would doubtless
pay handsomely.</p>

<p class='c007'>A public highway is projected from this place to Jundiahi,
the present terminus of the railway from Santos; and this
distance of thirty miles with wagons and mules would not
increase greatly the expenses on the products of a factory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon pricing a lot of horses and mules which passed
over the bridge while we were at the Salto, it was found
they could be bought from twenty-five dollars a head to
forty dollars a head, but none of them were above medium
quality and many quite inferior.</p>

<p class='c007'>In passing through the city of Itu we were shown an establishment
in which an eighteen-saw cotton-gin was moved
by a portable steam-engine; and there was in the building
a thirty-saw gin idle which might have been brought into
operation by the same power. There was also a small press
in use, and I counted ten hands of various sizes employed
around these little contrivances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Auburtin was much interested in this cotton-cleaning
and packing, as he is desirous of getting information as to
the extent and nature of the attention bestowed upon the
culture and treatment of the cotton in this and the neighboring
sections.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important for the railroad interest that cotton shall
be successfully cultivated in this region of country; and
this gentleman, with others connected with the company,
have done much in placing seed in the hands of planters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and in encouraging the growth of this staple. His visit
now, so far as I learn, has for its object the ascertaining of
the wants of the planters with a view to facilitating their
growth of cotton; and, as Major Meriwether has given him
the benefit of his large experience in growing this staple in
the Southern States, he may be able to enlighten the people
of Brazil somewhat in his next article.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of gentlemen, among whom were two brothers
of the Minister of Agriculture, accompanied our party this
afternoon to the quarry (lapidarea) of flagstone within a
mile of the city. There is an inexhaustible bed of crude
slate, of which the pavements of Itu present fine specimens;
and it is so firm that horses pass along the side-walks without
damage. The slabs in the quarry may be made of any
proportions desired, from the tile of a house-top to massive
steps and columns. It is so smooth and regular as to require
no polishing. While at the quarry we saw a huge
block raised from the mass beneath by simply inserting
crow-bars between the adjacent lamina of the stone. Different
strata present different thicknesses of these lamina,
suited to different objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city of Itu is made up to a large extent by the residence
of parties who own planting interests in the country
around, and many of them owning houses here spend most
of their time upon their fazendas, so that the population is
not usually proportionate to the number of the houses.
The buildings upon the main plaza have a fine appearance,
with iron railings in many instances to the second-story
balconies, which are ornamented with tasteful figures, gilding,
&#38;c. I am informed that a good dwelling may be rented
here, with garden, fruit trees, &#38;c., for less than a hundred
dollars a year; and the health of the location has a widespread
reputation. The people seen about this place have
a genteel look, and are generally neatly dressed, which bespeaks
a favorable feature of the society and the character
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Our old friend the Baron presented each of our party
with ear-picks and tooth-picks made by himself from the native
wood of the country, and showed us a very old plain
knife which was the only instrument used in making them.
This may be considered the baron’s amusement, and by
giving them to his friends he establishes a very close link
of association, as these two articles are more directly personal
than almost any thing else we use.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the way, the habit of placing tooth-picks upon the
table to be used after eating is a common usage of the best
people throughout all this country; and the fancy stands
for holding the wooden tooth-picks are generally of china,
but very frequently of silver, and representing a peacock or
other fowl.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Our energetic old friend, the Baron, being apprised of our
wish to make an early move, gave us breakfast at 6 o’clock.
For this we should doubtless feel under special obligations
to his two daughters, who are inmates of the house at present.
One is the wife of Senor Barros, at São Paulo, from
whom I brought a letter to the Baron, and with whom I
had travelled in the diligence in my first trip from Santos.
The other daughter is a widow whose husband died a few
years since.</p>

<p class='c007'>These ladies present an intelligent expression, and not
only graced the table with their presence on previous occasions,
but even at this extra early hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking our leave of this pleasant family we set out for
Porto Feliz, sixteen miles distant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands on this route are quite thin, but the cotton is
found to give a fair yield; and many farmers, who could
barely support their families formerly, have, by the cultivation
of cotton, realized a good return. Our friend Mr. Auburtin
has the credit of saving them from starvation by
introducing the cotton seed into the country; and, as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>old minister of the gospel told an abolitionist in by-gone
years, that the negroes of the South were fed on cotton
seed, so I tell him it is with these people. The amount and
quality of the grass in this region does not warrant grazing
farms, and yet the cattle seen on the roadside were generally
in good order.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached the town of Porto Feliz at 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>,
and were hospitably received by Senor Angilo Custodo de
Morais, who is a substantial and plain gentleman of much
kindness of heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The houses here are extended upon one street for half a
mile, and mostly one-story buildings, without much taste in
their structure. The church is a large building of less antiquated
style than most of those seen elsewhere, and, with a
spacious open plaza in front of it, presents the most comely
feature of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were informed that the best and most commodious
houses in the town could be rented for three dollars or four
dollars per month, and living in other respects is doubtless
equally cheap. I observed in one store a very full assortment
of all the variety of goods and utensils that are ordinarily
found in one of our promiscuous country-stores, and
on pricing various articles concluded that every thing was
quite as cheap as in the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having need for some medicine to give Mr. Bennaton, I
went to a druggist’s shop and was surprised to see the variety
and cheapness of the various standard articles of the
materia medica that are in common use.</p>

<p class='c007'>The population is about fifteen hundred, and the health
is said to be very good.</p>

<p class='c007'>The town is located immediately upon the Rio Tieté,
being, however, on an elevated bluff far above the level of
the water. We visited the old port, which formerly was the
point of embarkation for many persons descending the
river, and the river is passable for large canoes from this
point up to the Salto of Itu. Dr. Shaw and myself concluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>to take a bath, and upon swimming across the stream
it was found very swift and I was very much exhausted.
As the Doctor did not undertake to cross, I called to him to
meet me on my return, and, being a tall man, he waded into
the stream as far as he could stand. The effort in swimming
back had so completely exhausted me that he had to assist
me in getting ashore. My muscles became cramped, and
the current being very swift I could not resist it even when
on my feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>We observed here, what is very common at all the water-courses
near the towns, a number of negro women in various
stages of nudity, washing clothes. They don’t use tubs,
nor do they often use pots to boil clothes; but, going into
the stream with the articles, they are lashed into the water
and scrubbed until they become clean. There is usually a
preliminary soaking of twenty-four hours. Soap is used
sparingly, and I have seen in many places the leaves of a
bush used, which forms a lather, and serves the purpose of
soap very, satisfactorily. A process of bleaching by exposure
to the dew and sun alternately, for several days, is
resorted to for the nicer linen garments, which gives them
a very pretty, clear, white appearance; but the delay frequently
proves a great annoyance to those who are needing
their clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dorado is a fine, large fish, that is said to be abundant
in this river, but we failed to have any opportunity of testing
its qualities, nor did we see any other fish at this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were called on by the Catholic priest, the vicar of
this municipality, who is a mulatto of more than ordinary
intelligence; but my prejudice to being associated with
those having the negro blood could not be so entirely put
aside as to make me feel at ease with this colored gentleman.
His bearing was dignified and courteous, while he
professes to be much pleased at the prospect of having our
people to come into this province with their industrial arts.
He is a native of Bahia, and I learn that there are many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>people in that section having a large admixture of the
African blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prevalent idea that the dark complexion of many of
the people in this warm latitude is attributable to climate
only needs observation to illustrate that the presence of
negro blood is the source of the dark hue in most instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Natives of the country are seen whose skin is fair and
white as elsewhere; and, though it is evident that the Portuguese
race is not clear-skinned like the German, yet the
absence of blue eyes, light hair and florid complexion is a
very different thing from the tawny skin and curly hair so
frequently observed here. Any unusual darkness of hue
results from mixture of negro or Indian blood, rather than
from the hot sun or the tropical climate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of the Spanish race, it is known that the pure
Castilian is fair-skinned, with even a blond complexion,
while the ordinary dark hue of the Spaniard is attributable
to the mixture of Indian blood generally, and in some instances
to the amalgamation with the negro element.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Auburtin told our host that we did not wish to wait
for breakfast, but that a cup of coffee, with some bread and
butter, and a few fresh eggs, would be acceptable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Having disposed of the fresh eggs, &#38;c., we set out for
Epanema, and had considerable difficulty in ferreting out
the paths in the absence of a guide who had engaged to
conduct us to this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the lands on this route of twenty miles were
very good and yet were not under cultivation; while more
inferior lands were planted in corn and cotton, with moderately
good results.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one instance, where the more fertile soil had been
cleared and planted, the weeds and bushes had outgrown
the corn, so as to lead to the abandonment of the crop;
and it really looks as if the richness of the soil, which gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>trouble to keep the land clear, becomes a reason for not
cultivating it. There is a strange want of energy among
the common people of this country; and whatever requires
much labor, even to attain the best results, does not suit
their habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all this region, where coffee cannot be grown successfully,
the planters are engaging in the culture of cotton,
and with some there is quite a mania on the subject, so that
breadstuffs are likely to be neglected as formerly with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached the iron-works at Epanema about 11 o’clock
<span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, and the present superintendent, Senor Dom Joaquim
de Sonsa Mursa, extended a cordial welcome to our party.
His wife is a German lady, of fine appearance and much
intelligence, who speaks English; and by her kind attention
to our comfort made us feel quite at home. The large
house was clean and neat in all its parts, and her table was
very creditable to her skill as a housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>In looking around the old structures of this vast establishment
for working iron, it is a matter of surprise that
all should have been suffered to go to wreck. The gentleman
who has now undertaken the restoration of the iron-works
has a task imposed upon him which requires an
energy and tact independent of scientific attainments; and
there are practical difficulties which are not likely to be
overcome while the place continues under the auspices of
the Brazilian government.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a mountain of iron ore of superior quality which
must furnish material to any desired extent for all future
time. An inexhaustible supply of limestone is likewise
near at hand to furnish the requisite flux, besides affording
lime of an excellent quality. Sandstone is likewise found
in abundance near the works, and is now being used to face
the furnaces that are being refitted. In addition to these
articles a quarry of slate or flagstone is located in close
proximity.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is also a large amount of good timber growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>upon the mountain-slopes belonging to this property, which
may be used for making charcoal to be employed in the
furnaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands are of prime quality, being the best description
of terra rocha upon the slopes adjacent to the vast
reservoir of iron ore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under proper cultivation the soil here is suited to produce
every thing to the best advantage; and would yield
all the provisions that could be required by any number of
operatives that would be necessary for the successful working
of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of negroes, most of whom are now very old,
some cattle, and horses, and mules, belonging to the government,
are here under the charge of Major Dias Albuquerque,
who resides at the works, and has been the agent
of the government for several years, simply keeping the
property together without accomplishing any thing towards
arresting the decay of buildings and machinery.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a magnificent ruin; and one feels like he had been
transplanted to some vast relic of the ancients, to witness
such immense resources lying in a state of entire disorder
and neglect.</p>

<p class='c007'>This place was put in operation more than fifty years ago,
and at one time did a large business; but was subsequently
discontinued, and some of the machinery was removed to be
sent to another iron mine in the province of Matto-Grosso.
This never reached its destination, and lies useless at some,
point from which it is now impracticable to have it returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The site labors under a great difficulty in its isolated
position and want of transportation. But the resources
for producing the iron rail for a road would warrant the
erection of a rolling-mill, to prepare the means of building
a line of communication to some eligible point, and it
would be well for some enterprising capitalists to seriously
examine the advantages of a contract for these works,
with a view to a permanent occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>In visiting the various points we were supplied with
riding animals; and Mr. Bennaton will be furnished here
with two mules of the government to expedite our farther
exploration of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of us had comfortable quarters for the night, and Dr.
Shaw and Major Meriwether slept in a large bed, over
which a crown was suspended, in which the Emperor slept
upon the occasion of his visit to this establishment some
years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being supplied with breakfast, consisting in part of fresh
milk and butter of superior make, our party left Epanema
at 7 o’clock this morning and rode twelve miles to Sorocaba.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greater part of the route lies through campo lands
of the dark red order, having a hard and dry-looking grass
that is not eaten much by stock, and here and there a few
clumps of trees known as camponia, such as are left in a
rocky place of a field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon reaching the town we were received at the house
of Senor Coronel Manoel Lopez Oliveiro, to whom Mr.
Auburtin had a letter from the President of the province.
He was so much occupied with his cordial reception that
he did not introduce the rest of us until requested to do so
by Mr. Bennaton. So goes the world!</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Auburtin being the honored guest, was assigned a
suite of rooms alone; and the other four of us were quartered
together in an apartment of the same size, but all
were very comfortably provided for in every respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>This gentleman is a man of large means, and has two
cotton-gins with steam-power in the city, where he prepares
for the market not only the yield of his own fazenda but a
large amount purchased in the seed. He seems under some
special obligation to Mr. Auburtin for introducing his cotton
to favorable notice in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The explosion of a few rockets, and the ringing of the
church bells at midnight, in commemoration of the birth
of our Saviour, is the only indication we have had here of
Christmas. The only thing to attract attention is the suspension
of the ordinary avocation of life, and every one
seems to wear rather a serious aspect, than to indulge in
any hilarity or festivities on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>We walked out before breakfast to deliver some letters of
introduction to parties in the town, but none of them were
found, excepting Dom Oliveiro, who treated us very courteously,
and tendered us any assistance in his power. We
called also upon Senor Carlos Tolemei, who manifested
great readiness to aid us, inviting all to his house to-night.
Coffee had been served before going out, and we did not get
breakfast until ten o’clock, which was accompanied by tea
and cakes, as has been done at some other places, instead
of coffee and milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>We all rode out with Colonel Lopez to-day, to visit his
plantation, and found cotton, corn and beans, all growing
together upon the same ground. There is no regard for
rows in planting any of these articles, and the stand of cotton
is in some parts a little deficient, but in the main average;
the growth is good, and the number of bolls upon the advanced
portion is large. Some of the cotton has been
planted this season, but another portion has been cut off
from the growth of last season, and is springing up again
very luxuriantly. The crop gives evidence of good culture
with the hoe, and is quite free from grass or weeds, but the
cotton must suffer by mixture with corn and beans. The
soil, is dark and loose, with an admixture of large gravel,
making it very liable to wash, and hence the absence of the
plough in its culture is rather advantageous than otherwise,
and more especially as there are many steep hills under cultivation.
This land corresponds more to some of the cotton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>lands of the up-country in Georgia than any territory I
have seen in Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Carlos rode out with us, and invited the party to
visit his cotton-gin, moved by water-power, a few miles from
town, but time did not permit. Besides these, there is also
a cotton-gin in the town moved by steam, which is owned
by Senor Machado.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were visited this afternoon by Dom Oliveiro, Dom
Americo, Delegado of Police, and Municipal Judge, and
Senor José Leite Pintead, who proposed that we should
remain for an entertainment by the citizens, but our motto
being “duty before pleasure,” it could not be accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Vas, of Campinas, called also to see us, being here
on a trip of recreation. He informs me that Settequéda
has gone to Jahu, to purchase a fazenda in that section,
which is the first point of our exploration of those lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visit to the house of Senor Carlos was enjoyed by
all very much. His wife performs skilfully on the piano,
and he sings admirably well. Beer and champagne were
served with other refreshments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sorocaba contains about five thousand inhabitants, and
was formerly a great mart for mules, there being eighty
thousand sold here in a single season. It is very healthy,
and there is but one physician in the entire district to meet
all the needs of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city is located upon the Rio Sorocaba, from which
it doubtless derives its name.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a factory here of fancy whips, that is somewhat
famous throughout the province, and many of the ladies receive
presents of Sorocaba riding-whips from those who wish
to pay them a compliment. The structure of the whip is
most elaborate, being plated with material of different colors,
and a part of the larger end interwoven with fine pieces of
the quills of the porcupine. The butt of the whip is covered
with silver, and has a silver chain with some ornament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>attached to it, while there are two or three bands of silver
on the stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same place will be found also fancy bridles, trimmed
with silver; belts of most fantastic style; girth of rare patterns;
cruppers of every variety, and saddle cloths, which
are intended to be very ornamental on the animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>To appreciate the importance of this class of articles, it is
requisite to understand that many people here lay great
stress upon their outfit for riding, and the style differs materially
from that which we have been accustomed to see.
The bridles are made in this establishment by platting a
number of thongs of raw-hide into a flat or round form, which
constitute the headstall and reins of the bridle, with sundry
silver rings at different points of each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the reins unite at the hand there are two rings,
secured together by a small strap, and from each of these
extends loose ends of some two feet in length, which may
be used for whipping or for securing the animal. Martingales
are very seldom used in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having exhausted the resources of the place by our observations,
we left Sorocaba at eight o’clock this morning,
after being supplied with a cup of coffee and some biscuits
by our host.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our passage through dreary campo lands for three leagues
(twelve miles) brought us to Campo Largo, which is a very
comely little village of the mud-built type. Proceeding
from this some miles, we began to observe the slopes on our
right under cultivation, with a number of neat settlements
along the lower part of the hills, which continued for a considerable
distance on our course.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rain fell heavily at one time, but we had the good
fortune to have a house for protection, having stopped to
examine some mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped for the night at Capello de Alto, and soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>found that a pile of pea vines had to be our bed, while there
were no knives and forks to eat with. A can of my tomatoes
assisted in making out the grub, and with collards,
beans, farina and stewed chicken, we made a very substantial
repast, this being the only meal of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>My blanket and pillow, which had been of little use heretofore,
came now into requisition, and the others used their
overcoats for bedding.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proprietor of this establishment was evidently well
satisfied with the outfit of his house, and we all thought him
the most independent-looking personage we had met. He
was attired in white cotton pants or drawers, with a short
shirt of the same material outside. Having a large goatee,
and long, uncombed hair, he cut a figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the conviction that we could not fare worse elsewhere,
we made an early move from Capella de Alto, hoping
to find a place for breakfast within ten or twelve miles. But
there was no suitable place to stop until we reached Lamberi,
sixteen miles distant, and having rode very slowly, we
got nothing to eat until two o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Our road to-day lay through a hilly country, and though
the soil was for the most part thin, there was some very
fair farming land. In several places there were campos of
waste land, growing only a rough grass and the scrubby
palm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite a number of the native men of the country were
seen about the ranchos on the roadside, and the recruiting
officers might find a good harvest in this region. Many of
the older men, and most of the women, were affected with
the goitre, that swelling of the glands of the neck which is
prevalent in the proximity of most of the serras. We observed
also, as we approached this place, quite a number of
persons laboring under the leprosy (Morfea) posted on the
roadside, to ask alms of those passing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>This miserable condition is a disease of the skin and other
tissues, which is supposed to result from the climate in connection
with improper diet; and is complicated in some
instances with syphilis, or other degenerated states of the
system. The treatment of it has not heretofore been attended
with satisfactory results, but I learn that a vine has
been discovered which cures this terrible malady, and the
efficacy of this treatment will ere long be fully tested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subjects of this disorder are excluded from all association
with other persons, and are often found in tents or rude
huts, in some isolated spot, near the thoroughfares, so that
they may gather a small pittance from travellers, to purchase
the means of subsistence. They seem very grateful for even
the smallest amount that may be given, and we have usually
thrown them a few dumps, but there was none in hand to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>This being my forty-first birthday, I find myself at the
middle period of life with a crisis in my affairs which must
influence the future of myself and family very materially.
To commence the world as it were anew with six young
children involves great responsibility to my wife and myself;
but I trust that all may be accomplished for our
mutual welfare and comfort, by the issue of my present
investigations in this county.</p>

<p class='c007'>The past is to be separated from the future with more
distinctness than any other periods of my existence have
been, not only by the change of events but by the alterations
of our social relations; and the rending of old ties and
establishing of new associations makes the prospective
change of location a very serious consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circumstances in which we will be placed may not
admit of those advantages in rearing and educating our
children which they would have enjoyed under a different
order of things; and I realize that many duties as a man
and parent devolve upon me now that differ much from
those of former years.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>But being imbued with a deep-rooted sentiment of self-reliance,
it is still my privilege to exercise those energies of
body and those faculties of mind which God has given me,
for promoting the welfare of those dependent upon me.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>December 28, 1865</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>Having taken a cup of coffee at the inn of mine host,
Captain Marianno, we set out at 5 o’clock this morning,
and after a ride of twelve miles over hills and plains, we
reached the town of Itapetininga.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The first four miles
lay through an irregular matto, with numerous very steep
hills; but the remaining eight miles were through campos
of gently undulating lands. Upon these there were several
groups of horses and a few herds of cattle, but neither presented
an appearance that would recommend this region for
stock-raising.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped with Senor Lenente Coronel Manoel Affonso
Pereira Chaves, and though plain in his garb and manner,
we were made to realize that we were heartily welcomed,
while he exhibited an intelligence and general acquaintance
with this region which promises to be very useful to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon conferring with a French engineer named Prudent,
who has been employed by the government in constructing
a road from this place to Sette Barros, on the Ribeira de
Ignape, Mr. Bennaton concluded this route would be impracticable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>and determined to proceed to Paranapanema.
All the roads across the serra leading to the river are said
to be in very bad order, but it being the business of this
engineer to put this road in good order, it would be well
for the authorities to investigate the cause of failure, and
perhaps it would be found that another man would be more
faithful to his charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people here partake generally of the mental and physical
characteristics of the country, and there is very little
taste displayed in their dwellings or other houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new theatre, which is not yet completed, is by far the
neatest structure in the town, while the church is ready to
tumble down from age and decay.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of the place is similar to most of those seen,
having a central open space near the church, and the streets
laid off elsewhere at right angles and not usually more than
thirty feet wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the houses have but a single story, yet there are
some exceptions, and our host has quite a large two-story
residence, which, however, is not yet completed. Senor
Chaves has presented me with a history of the province of
São Paulo, for which I feel very thankful; and it will be
made one of my text-books in learning the Portuguese language.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a stream of water on one side of the town upon
which there is a saw-mill, and a cotton-gin is soon to be in
operation also at the same place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this facility for water-power, we witnessed
the stupendous folly of a small cotton-gin with
eighteen saws in operation by the force of a treadmill,
worked by the leg-power of men; and a screw was also seen
at the same place worked by manual force of these bipeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this apparatus there is a huge upright wheel of fifteen
feet diameter, in which a man is constantly walking, and
yet not advancing; and two other men are standing upon
a platform outside of the rim of the wheel so as to use their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>feet upon certain pegs of wood, and thus assist the rotary
motion. Four different bands and wheels without number
are used to communicate this motion to the gin, and all this
when mules and oxen are running idle about the town. A
Portuguese is the owner of this stupid contrivance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host favored us with an early breakfast, and we set
out at 8 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> on the road leading to Paranapanema.
Passing the Rio Itapetininga we traversed campos varied
with patches of matto for twenty miles, when we stopped
at a wayside inn kept by Senor José Ribeiro. The configuration
of the lands over which we passed was irregular,
and in some places extensive gullies or ravines had resulted
from the washing of the rains. Most of the soil of the campos
in this region is of a reddish aspect, while the matto
lands are of a dark gray color, and producing fair crops
under cultivation. Corn was observed growing well, and
cotton is said to yield favorably.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Irish potato was seen in a flourishing state at one
place on the road to-day, and we are informed that this
vegetable grows successfully in most parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who plant cotton in this section are under the necessity
of taking it in the seed to the gins at Itapetininga,
and we saw some being carried on pack-mules in this form,
a large basket being on each side.</p>

<p class='c007'>At our stopping place we were informed that the proposed
route from Paranapanema to Xiririca was in wretched condition,
and I suggested that it would still be practicable to
reach the Ribeira de Ignape at Iporanga, by way of Faxina
and Apiahy. This lead to a warm controversy between Mr.
Bennaton and myself as to undertaking that trip under all
the disadvantages presented, but it was finally concluded to
continue our present course.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Starting at 7 o’clock this morning we passed over a beautiful
campo country with a portion of fair matto land, and
crossing the Rio Paranapanema we reached the town of
that name at 3 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, making a distance of twenty-eight
miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were more horses and cattle seen to-day upon the
green plains than upon any previous portion of our route,
and this presents a fine prospect for raising stock of all
kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Small patches of good arable land, with a growth of trees,
are scattered at long intervals throughout these extended
undulating campos, and there are also trees growing along
the small streams which meets all the demands for fuel or
for making enclosure about the houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within four miles of the town there is a large fazenda in
the open land owned by Senor Francisco Antonio D’Aquiar
e Castro, (son of the Marquiza de Santos,) who resides at
São Paulo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we saw that manure renders these lands productive,
and the best specimen of cabbage seen in Brazil was growing
in the garden, while other articles also looked vigorous.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a large number of hogs in most excellent condition
enclosed in a pen, and the number of corn-cobs
showed that this staple was produced plentifully in this
section.</p>

<p class='c007'>We met on the road beyond the fazenda a lot of fine hogs
going to market, and asking the price it was stated to be
seven dollars per head, and as they would average two hundred
pounds, meat does not exceed three and a half cents
per pound.</p>

<p class='c007'>The buildings of the fazenda are commodious and substantial,
with a dwelling that presents quite a neat appearance.
A supply of clear water is brought from a distance
by a race or ditch; and I especially observed the slight impression
made upon this firm red clay soil by the passage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the rapid current of water through the yard into the lot
for the hogs and cattle.</p>

<p class='c007'>An extensive and very strong enclosure for the stock of
cattle was constructed by having large upright posts placed
in the ground, with a groove on each side, to receive the
ends of poles, one above another, thus forming a most substantial
close fence. Around this enclosure a row of trees
has been planted, and protected by a railing of poles some
three and a half feet from the ground; which will in a few
years afford a good shade for such cattle as may be kept
up. This planting of trees for shading is not often seen in
any part of this country, and it is a matter of special attention
in this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>On riding into the town we met Senor Frei Ponsiano de
Montaldo Capushinho, to whom we bore a letter, which
being read, we were assured of his readiness to accommodate
us.</p>

<p class='c007'>He is the Catholic priest of the place, and has the best
establishment we saw. I observed the facings of the windows
were of native pine, which grows very large and extensively
at no great distance. The church is a combination
of the old building with a new structure, but all in a
rude, unfinished condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our inquiries at Paranapanema satisfy all the party
that it will not be practicable to reach Xiririca with our
animals; and in view of the distance to Iporanga, the prearranged
plan of visiting the country upon the Ribeira de
Ignape has been abandoned by my friends, Dr. Shaw and
Major Meriwether. But as I am not prone to give up any
thing desirable because of the difficulties to be encountered,
I expect to proceed to Iporanga with animals and a camarada
hired by Mr. Bennaton, and thence I will descend
the river to Xiririca, where I hope to find Mr. Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time Mr. Bennaton will go with the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>gentlemen to Botocatu and the region of Perecicaba, including
a visit to the country around Araraquara. They
will give me a report in writing of the impressions connected
with the localities visited,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and I expect to furnish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>them an account of my observations, so that each party
may be informed as to the entire territory examined.</p>

<p class='c007'>My proposed route, lying between the serra and the
river, will give me a very good idea of the lands on this side
of the river; and my investigations may be extended afterwards
to the other side. The climate below Xiririca is said
to be very unfavorable from the rains and fogs which prevail;
but above that line the atmosphere is reported to be
free from humidity and to be healthy; while the lands are
represented as being fertile and adapted to all variety of
products grown in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temperature here to-day is remarkably cool for this
latitude, the thermometer being this evening 62° Fahrenheit;
and there is a considerable breeze, with a slight drizzle of rain,
which is said to be very common during this season. The
town and country are however represented as healthy, and
there is no physician residing in the municipality or district.
Here, as elsewhere, the glands of the neck among
the women are enlarged very much.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>There is quite an assemblage of people here to join in
the festivities of New Year’s Eve, and extensive preparations
for a grand bonfire and illumination, with a display
of fire-works on the fantastic order. A square pen of wood
has been built in the open plaza to the height of fifteen (15)
feet, with a collection of small sticks arranged on top for
ignition, all of which is expected to burn to the ground in
the course of the evening or night. The illumination at
the front of the church is made by cups of the peel of a
half orange, having oil and a taper, all arranged into the
shape of a cross, but they do not give much brilliancy, and
this display is rather a failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rockets are of great variety; some giving reports like
a musket, others discharging several balls of different hues,
and again a few having a reversed action, by which a blazing
mass is sent down amidst the men, women, and children,
or dividing into numerous streams of fire, which dash hither
and thither in all directions. The revolving fire-works were
decidedly successful at the close.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few brass instruments and a violin in the hands of
genteel Germans afforded very good music.</p>

<p class='c007'>This morning is clear and beautiful, with the thermometer
at 64° degrees Fahrenheit, having risen two degrees
since last night. Nature seems to be all in smiles to welcome
the return of a new year. Oh, that my heart could
feel in unison with this bright and sunny morning!</p>

<p class='c007'>But while all around is joyous, all within is sadness. The
old year of 1865 has come to a close, and the events which
have transpired shroud the retrospect with gloom and sadness.
Horrible in their reality, and almost maddening to
the thought, I would gladly if it were in my power cease
to think of what is past. Could the fruitless martyrdom
of my three noble brothers be forgotten, the sad fate of
many who are left behind cannot be torn from my consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and consigned to oblivion. The fact that my
own wife and children have been deprived of a house and
home by the ruthless hand of the hostile incendiary, stares
me constantly in the face as a terrible reality. I cannot
but feel very anxious for the present condition and the
future well-being of those near and dear to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four months entire have now elapsed since any intelligence
has reached me from them or other friends, and the
disturbed state of society around them causes me much
concern.</p>

<p class='c007'>My heart feels a weight and depression not in keeping
with the advent of a new year; but, flying from the dark
abyss of misery which reflection brings to view, let me
occupy my thoughts with the persons and things around me.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sound of music awoke us at early dawn, and several
pieces were performed to welcome the coming of another
year. Upon going out, we found quite a transformation in
the plaza, by the planting of forty-two palm trees (species
of palmetto) during the night, making an avenue from the
front of the church. They are not expected to grow, but
are merely placed here as a part of the festivities of the occasion,
to be continued to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The companions of my voyage thus far have now left
me to return to Itapetininga, from which point they will
proceed to Botocatu. Two mules were brought here by
Mr. Bennaton, though it was known that no further provision
was to be made for me. This purchase, at forty-seven
and a half ($47.50) dollars for a saddle-mule, and thirty-five
($35) dollars for a pack-mule, is considerably below the prices
at the capital, but above the average valuation in this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outfit for three men and three attendants now consists
of eighteen animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>I remain here for the camarada, Senor Pedro Crano
D’Oliveiro, to come with his mules, and proceed with me
through the woods to Iporanga. All these men, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>performing menial service, expect a certain deference to be
shown them; and it is customary to give them the title of
respect implied by Senhor on all occasions. In fact, no
freeman, white or black, is ever addressed here without this,
but it is usual to prefix it to the first part of the name, even
with persons of distinction, instead of using the surname or
family name as is done with us, in prefixing the word Mister
through respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>My old friend, the Catholic priest, who is vicar of this
district, has given me a letter to a friend in Xiririca, and
has likewise procured another from a gentleman here to a
party in Iporanga, so that I will get assistance in both
places, should I fail to meet Senor Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>The priest belongs to the order of Friars, and signs himself
accordingly Frei, in the prefix to his name. He has
gone out to attend to his duties at the church, leaving us
at his house without seeming to expect that any of us took
any interest in attending the services. The long flowing
gown, with a monk’s hood hanging on the shoulders, is worn
habitually, as indeed the clerical attire is the common dress
of priests everywhere in this country; but when he goes to
the church, the ceremonial vestments are taken by his page
to be used in the services.</p>

<p class='c007'>I went to the church to-day for the purpose of witnessing
the proceedings of the festa by the vicar; and with the assistance
of a number of persons who were attired for the
occasion, he went through various incomprehensible manœuvres,
that served to attract and interest the large concourse
of people. At the close of these performances,
rockets and other sonorous fire-works were exploded most
profusely.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon there was a grand procession of these
demonstrative people, in honor of our Lady of Conception,
(Nossa Senhora de Conceicão.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The figure of a female seated on a platform, that rested
on a sort of hand-barrow, was carried upon the shoulders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>four men, and another figure, representing some of the saints,
supported in like manner, accompanied it, while a large rich
awning was hoisted upon the ends of six poles in the hands
of as many men, under which the old vicar and a brother
priest moved forward with certain symbols, among which
was a silver cross encircled by a halo of brightness. This
other priest is also a friar, and gives his name in full as
Frei José de Loro, Director de Tijuco Preto, Ministerio
Apostolico Capuchinho. He is from Italy, as is also the
old vicar, the former being in this country only eight
months, while the latter has been here twenty years, and
says he has almost forgotten his native tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Formed into line, with music in full blast, they marched
in much apparent solemnity with their heads bowed, throughout
the principal streets of the town, accompanied by most
of the men, women and children that were present. On the
return of the procession, the explosion of fire-works was
deafening, and had an appearance in mid-heaven like the
bursting of bombshells, when a hot engagement of artillery
is progressing.</p>

<p class='c007'>An address was subsequently made in the church by the
vicar, but was not adapted to my limited comprehension
of the language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proportion of men present was small, and for the
most part scrawny specimens, with very shabby dress,
having in many instances a sort of cloak (ponché) which
covers all other deficiencies of dress. The absence of men
having better physique is attributable to their apprehension
of being recruited for the army, which induces them to forego
the indulgence of public festivities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of women in attendance was very large, and
with few exceptions of mixed blood, either of the Indian or
negro. Some of them were comely in form and neatly
dressed, but far the greater number were downright ugly.
Here, more even than at other places, the old and the young
have the glands of the neck enlarged, constituting goitre,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>or, as called here, “papo.” This affection is ascribed to
various causes; humidity of the atmosphere, bad diet, or
deficiency of nutritious food, sleeping in exposed situations,
combined with the water of the serras, are the usual concomitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the vicinity of the Alps, it is known to prevail extensively,
and is attributed by some writers to the use of snow-water.
But here we have no snow-water, while there exists
a geological formation in these serras which corresponds
to that mountainous region; and it is highly probable that
there exists some peculiar mineralogical principle in the
water coming from these elevations which produces this
result.</p>

<p class='c007'>The better class of people are rarely seen with it, yet even
those with all the comforts of life are not entirely exempt
when living in these situations adjacent to a serra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old vicar has a woman with several children in the
house with him, who is housekeeper and without a husband;
while the youngest of the children indicates clearly its paternity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those acquainted with the habits of some of the priesthood
in Brazil will not regard this allusion as indelicate, or
involving any thing unbecoming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though there were servants about the house, the vicar
insisted upon doing most that was required for us.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Soon after I arose this morning, my old camarada, Senor
Pedro, came in to make the announcement that all was
ready for the anticipated voyage, and attributed his failure
to go on yesterday to the straying of a mule. But my inference
is, that he could not bear the idea of leaving this
festa and grand procession, and availed himself of a subterfuge,
to quiet my impatience under the delay beyond his
time appointed for starting.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was supplied with a cup of coffee, and gave my old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>friend, the vicar, a heartfelt expression of my thanks for
his kindness; when he gave me his best wishes for a prosperous
voyage, and embraced me after the Brazilian manner,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
with a warmth which made me feel that I was leaving
a real friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>In repairing to the house of Senor Pedro, he provided
some farina, stew of beef, and big hominy, with bananas,
for my breakfast, which were despatched with the aid of a
spoon, as knives and forks seemed to be no part of his
household furniture. This finished, I found that all the
family were preparing to set out with us, as we were to go
that day to a place owned by this man some twenty miles
distant in the country. The horses for the women were
brought through the house and taken into the back yard
for them to mount. They soon sallied forth all astride,
with their skirts so arranged as to cover their nether extremities,
and, having drawers with straps under their feet,
they were in regular trim for the expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old woman and three grown daughters were all
mounted after this style, and seemed to use their stirrups
and manage their horses as if they had been used to this
mode of travelling. Their saddles are somewhat different
from those used by the men, having a quilted seat, which
serves as a cushion to protect them in riding astride.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon going out of town, we fell in with another party of
women who had a more genteel appearance, and were seated
in the ordinary way upon side-saddles,—one of them being
especially well provided with horse and equipments. She
was a young lady, very tidily dressed, and rather the best-looking
woman seen in this section. One of the women of
this party was the wife of a son of my old camarada, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>her husband was carrying their only child before him on his
mule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third member of this party was the mother of the
other two women, but they are all of a very different stamp
from the family to which they have become connected by
marriage, and I could not but think they viewed our party
of women astride of their horses as presenting a disgusting
aspect. One of the daughters of my escort had a young
child, and carried it most of the way in her arms, while her
mother, an old woman of fifty years, carried it the rest of
the time. These women rode the entire twenty miles astride
without dismounting, and did not show any particular
fatigue on arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within half a mile of Paranapanema we entered the forest,
and, for three miles, the soil was red, and would certainty
produce a fair yield of any thing that might be cultivated.</p>

<p class='c007'>This land lay remarkably level for the general character
of the country, and yet none of it has ever been cleared
up. Passing through this, the soil was of a dark aspect,
with a clay basis, and, though sundry ravines interrupted
the configuration of the surface, there was a great deal of
land lying very favorably. Very little of it has been brought
into use, but the few specimens of corn seen along the road
presented a good appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon approaching the place of Senor Pedro, a considerable
river, São José, came into view; and he informs me
that there is a water-fall of great extent, ten or twelve miles
below, which is surrounded by timber, and yet has a road
passing very near to it. This might be turned to account,
should any one be tempted to locate in this drear and rude
wilderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>After our arrival, I accompanied Senor Pedro to examine
his corn, and found it growing very luxuriantly—the stalks
being, in most parts, ten feet high, and standing close upon
the ground. His calculation is for thirty bushels to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>acre, but it is likely to exceed that yield, if the earing is at
all proportionate to the present prospect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country just at this place is very hilly, and there
seems to be a great preference to the hillsides for planting,
from the fact doubtless that the soil is better than on the
level land.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are pumpkin vines growing finely in this corn, and
cucumber vines, and watermelon vines were seen in a patch
near by growing well; yet none of them are sufficiently advanced
to determine the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>The few and isolated settlements seen upon our route to-day,
as well as the one at which I am stopped, show very
little regard for the comforts of life, or very little advance
in civilized life.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a picture of the interior of this domicil could be adequately
portrayed, it would be a rich legacy to posterity,
to dwell upon the meagre and filthy surroundings of this
able-bodied family. In eating, the victuals were put on a
towel upon a bench, and I occupied the only seat that was
afforded by the establishment, while the fare was limited to
farina, pork, and big hominy, with coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have looked at the bright side of society in this province,
and now the opportunity is afforded to view and study
another phase of the people; but the transition is sad to
contemplate, and worse still to realize by actual participation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only redeeming feature about the place is a few very
fat hogs in the yard, and there has not been seen anywhere
more fat on an animal than covers one of these hogs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mules are also in fine condition, and most excellent
travellers. What is out of doors meets the requirements
of life very well, but enter the house and all is squalid
wretchedness and beastly slovenliness. The people fare
worse than the brutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>My old camarada having me now in his power, informed
me that it would be necessary to take one more horse than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>was expected in his arrangement with Mr. Bennaton, and
that instead of going for ten dollars as he had agreed, that
he must have seventeen dollars and fifty cents. Upon my
objecting he then named fifteen dollars, saying that he would
have to take provisions for us and the animals; and, under
all the circumstances, I acceded to this proposition, as it
is the exact amount supplied by Mr. Bennaton for expenses.</p>

<p class='c007'>I brought out my blanket and pillow last night to facilitate
the preparations of mine host for my night’s rest; and
a rude bedstead with cords of the sipo vine, over which were
some matting, a horse-blanket, and a sheet, gave promise of
comfort. But the numerous fleas beset me so that I was
induced to strip off shirt and drawers and wrap up in the
blanket to protect myself against them. Getting once clear
of these pests, and having the woollen blanket next my person,
it was impracticable for them to make an entrance, as
their legs get tangled in the wool so as prevent jumping,
or even crawling to any considerable extent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is somewhat remarkable that no bedbugs or chinches
have been seen in this country, and it is fortunate for the
lower classes (who are so filthy) that this insect does not
propagate here to any large extent.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am sitting upon my trunk writing, while the corn is
being shelled and other arrangements are progressing for
our outfit. My two tin-plates, and knife and fork, have
been brought forth for use here, and upon the voyage. I
gave my friends at Paranapanema upon separating a can of
tomatoes, and one of partridge, reserving two cans of tomatoes
and one of mutton for this trip; and, from the present
aspect of affairs, they are likely to be in urgent demand, as
supplies are scarce.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the men working on this place has shot a large
monkey, and these people tell me that these ugly animals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>are frequently eaten here, but I hope it will not be served
up for our trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the advantages I hoped to derive in being separated
entirely from those speaking English was improvement
in the use of the Portuguese language, but these caipiras
have such a bad pronunciation that I have considerably
greater difficulty in communicating with them than with
educated Brazilians, and there is not much encouragement
to learn any of the language from them, so that I will talk
no more than is needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a great trial to my patience, we started at noon, and
I found the son was to accompany the old man as my escort
for the voyage. Making a halt at the son’s house, I
found a cucumber lying on the table, and getting some salt,
it was enjoyed very much. This is a new place, as is also
that of the wife’s family near by, and there are a number of
new shanties through this obscure tract of country, which
have been built as retreats for those getting out of the way
of recruiting officers. I witnessed the modus operandi of
dodging the issue this morning, in the movements of a man
and his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was mounted astride of one horse, and sundry supplies
of eatables were packed in panniers upon another
tackey, while the man went afoot with his gun. Upon inquiry
as to their destination, the only answer was, that they
were going into the forest to sojourn for a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country passed through to-day was for the most part
hilly and very poor, having the native pine in great number
and of large size, which here, as its namesake with us, is
an indication generally of thin soil. The wood of this is
more like the soft white pine, and not much used.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour before sundown we reached a house, when my
escort intimated to me we would stop for the night. I suggested
that we had made a very short journey, being only
fifteen miles, and that it was some time until night; yet he
said there was no house, water, or pasture to be found at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>any convenient distance, so that I had to acquiesce. Now
we shall see more of caipira life, but in somewhat better
condition than the miserable abode of my old camarada’s
family. The house was a very good mud wall and thatched
roof structure, with four divisions; one being for the corn,
another the cooking-apartment, and the two others for sleeping-rooms.
As the manner of constructing the walls of
these houses is characteristic of this class of people, it may
be stated that upright timbers are placed in the ground at
the corners, and at such other points as the size of the
building requires, upon which rests the plates for the roof.
Between these uprights are arranged vertically and longitudinally,
making a check-work, numerous small strips or
laths of the palmetto, upon which is plastered a mortar
composed of clay with an admixture of cow-dung. This
last-named article is used in this country to give tenacity
to the mortar, and, from the general resort to it, I infer that
it must serve a good purpose. A wall plastered in this way
on the outside and inside gives protection to the inmates
from the weather, and, if not subjected to any violence, will
remain for a number of years in good condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>These thatched houses (palhaçar casas) are covered with
a kind of long coarse grass, or with the leaves of a species
of palm, secured to the laths of the roof by the sipo vine;
and each layer extending partly over the foregoing, a very
thorough security against rain is effected. With occasional
repairs, this covering serves as protection for ten or twelve
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such walls, and with such a covering, an earth floor is
usually found, and this may be the natural soil, if in a clay
region, but is usually made with mortar, such as is used on
the walls. As it is very rare to see a chimney in any kind
of a house in Brazil, this style of building is of course without
any other place for a fire than upon the dirt floor, in
the middle of the apartment used for cooking, and the
smoke finds its way through the roof as best it may.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>The house at which we are to spend the night is owned
by Senor José Francisco de Aranna, who is a tall, dark-skinned
man, and probably having a mixture of Indian and
negro blood; while his wife is a stout and rather comely
white woman, being much fairer complexioned than most
of those seen in this country. She seemed to be expected
to perform most of the labor about the establishment, and
got our dinner ready in a reasonable time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The table for myself and my two attendants consisted of
a large stool, having a cloth which only partially covered
it, upon the middle of which was poured a large pile of farina,
and upon each of three corners were plates, filled with regular
home-made hominy and pieces of pork which had been
cooked with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not having met with any gritz before, since coming to
Brazil, I enjoyed this dish hugely.</p>

<p class='c007'>After it was disposed of, these plates were removed and
others with small bits of fried pork were set down before
each of us, which were to be eaten with the farina; but my
appetite had been pretty well satisfied with the previous
abundant supply, and I ate but little of this, while, however,
my attendants made clean plates. Again we were called
upon to partake of a dessert of big hominy, which was very
nice, but beyond the capacity of my stomach, yet the other
men managed to worry down all that was served.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I have stated elsewhere, the big hominy is made here
with the whole grains of corn, by being pounded in a mortar,
and they don’t seem to know any thing of treating it with
lime or ashes, to remove the outside. Its use is confined
entirely to the category of dessert, even among the best
people in the land, under the name, cangica.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the articles furnished on this occasion were substantial,
and the surroundings clean, the style of serving
them was very primitive and plain, presenting a fair type
of the living among the better order of caipiras.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host filled out the backwoods character by giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>me some music on the viola, which is an instrument resembling
the banjo, but with metallic strings, and is in great
repute with these people. He sang at my request, which
gave a zest to his performance, and I gave the best evidence
of the soothing influence of his music by going to sleep
during the rather protracted performance. Being in the
dark, none of the party observed this act of appreciation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I was honored during the night with the only bedstead in
the house, consisting of some forks driven into the ground,
upon which some small straight poles were laid, and having
over them a piece of flag matting. With the assistance of
my blanket and pillow, my sleep was profound and refreshing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man who accompanied me reposed in the crib
upon the unhusked corn, while the son spent the night in
some equally convenient place, of which I was not advised.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were not permitted to leave without breakfast, and
giving again the bill of fare will afford a farther specimen
of the good things enjoyed by this class of people. The
immense pile of farina on the cloth in the middle of the
stool greets us at the outset, with a big deep plate full of
beans and small pieces of meat for each of us, on the corners
of this temporary table. There being no seats about the
house, I use my trunk as was done last evening, and the
others hunker down to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was followed by plates of soup, in which the beans
and meat had been cooked, and we were expected to eat
farina with it. There is a peculiar art with these people, in
throwing the farina into their mouths with a spoon, and not
touching the lips with it, so that all use the same spoon
without any indelicacy, in eating from the common pile.
Next came the big hominy, and we closed with plates of
sweet milk. These articles should have been served together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>and thus conformed to the usages among the better class,
but they were furnished separately in this caipira regime.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had no coffee here, and as it is more in keeping with
these people to use the rum of the sugar-cane, (cachaça), it
was tendered but declined.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observed after eating each time, that my camaradas
rose to their feet, and bringing their hands in contact before
them, went through some short ceremony, which was construed
as a thanksgiving for what they had received. This
I presume is peculiar to the class, as nothing of the sort
has been observed among the better order of people. There
is no asking of blessing at table, or returning thanks, nor is
there any family worship, where I have been heretofore; but
among these people I heard a service at the house of Senor
Pedro, before I rose in the morning, which seemed to be
some devotional exercise on the part of the family; and it is
evident that some of them have more regard for religious
observance than the more refined class of society throughout
this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning my acknowledgments for the hospitality received,
we took our leave of this very respectable backwoods
family and set out, with the assistance of another caipira to
show us the route.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were shown first into a blind path, leading down a
steep hill, and with a continuation of hills and hollows
through the woods for a considerable distance, but reached
after a time a plainer way, leading by the most irregular and
winding course that ever man or beast has travelled. It
was that style of substitute for a road known here by the
name picado, and consists in having a few of the small saplings
and shrubs cut out, so that a horse may pass, and
scarcely permitting a rider to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one time the knees are in contact with a tree in making
a short turn; at another, a limb or bent cane of immense
size endangers the head, and but for the use of the large
sheath-knives carried by the camaradas, the path would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>have been impassable in many parts. These tremendous
cutlasses, with which every camarada and almost every
traveller is equipped, are equal to a small axe in clearing
away obstructions; and though it looks somewhat savage
to see them sticking in the belt of almost every man upon
a voyage, they are very useful, and even necessary, in a trip
such as the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither of my attendants wore shoes, and upon entering
this narrow and rugged path, beset with brambles and
thorns, they rolled up their breeches above their knees,
having less fear of tearing their flesh than of injuring their
clothes. Indeed their scanty outfit of wearing apparel made
this precaution very proper, in view of the tough appearance
of the natural covering of their legs. With my boots
outside of my pants I secured a like immunity from damage
to my raiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>From our entrance into these woods until we passed out
into the Faxina road, a distance of sixteen miles, we were
surrounded by lands which were evidently of good quality;
and yet, for the most part, so hilly as to render their cultivation
very difficult. A portion of the soil is what is known
among us as mulatto land, and other parts of a dark gray
aspect. The supply of water at all points is quite sufficient
for domestic uses, but only two places that would afford
facilities for erection of machinery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remoteness of these lands belonging to the public
domain from a market, and the great difficulty of getting a
practicable road in any direction, must be a barrier to the
occupation of this territory; otherwise it might be a desirable
location for families.</p>

<p class='c007'>I observed in the midst of this immense forest a small
pole pen, and, upon inquiry, learned that it had been used
for confining hogs at night that were driven along this route
to Iporanga.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nature of the soil and the character of the growth
changed materially on reaching the large open road; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>here again we encountered the pine, indicating thin land,
though lying more favorably.</p>

<p class='c007'>After proceeding upon this road, leading from the town
of Faxina to Iporanga for four miles, we halted for the
night at a beautiful stream, and I availed myself of the opportunity
to take a most refreshing bath after the fatiguing
day’s travel.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had travelled twenty miles only, but, considering the
nature of the road, it was a good result.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the horses had grazed around until they were satisfied,
they all came up near our rancho and stood for some
time, in expectation of something more substantial. But
just then the men were preparing dinner, and while we were
eating our broiled pork and farina, of which the meal consisted,
the animals all moved off upon the road we had come.
I intimated to them that the animals were going away, “Os
animals estão indo embora,” to which one of them simply
replied, that they would not go far, “Não vão longe;” but
after finishing his grub the old man set out in search of
them upon my suggesting that they would probably return
to his house, “Talves aquelles animals voltarão a sua casa.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After he had been gone for half an hour, I perceived the son
was getting very anxious, but nothing was said indicating
any misgivings, while it struck me very forcibly that we
might be destined to camp here much longer than desirable.
At length the young man started off on the road, when I
called to him “Onde vai, Senhor?” (Where are you going,
sir?) To which he replied that he was going for fuel—“para
lenha,” and turned into the woods. My impression was
that he was starting to look for the old man and the mules,
but I had no idea of being left here in the wild woods alone,
and I kept my eye on his movements closely. At length
the old man returned with the animals, having run some
two miles to overtake them on their homeward-bound
course; and they have received a caution, which will enable
them in future to understand the movements of these brutes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>They now gave them their corn, and confining the only
horse in the train with a bell on his neck, as a rendezvous
signal, the mules were allowed to go at large for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>We found at this place an old dilapidated rancho of the
palm leaves, and seeing that a rain was approaching I
stretched my blanket under this, and it served to protect
all three of us from the showers that occurred at intervals
during the night. My position was on the outside, the
others between me and the fire; and the thought occurred
to me more than once that any wild beast that might approach
from these dense woods must come upon me first,
yet I did not care to lie so near the fire as the change would
bring me, and gave no signs to them of having any apprehension.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A pot of beans with the shank-bone and feet of a shoat
having boiled over the fire during the night, the coffee was
promptly prepared and the breakfast was soon served, when
I moved off to encounter the worst roads that can ever be
travelled. Each of the party was well mounted, and our
two pack-mules were substantial and active; but it was with
the greatest difficulty that the animals scrambled up the
hills, and required the greatest care in sliding down the
steep slopes, while the ridges and mud-holes in the comparatively
level portions of the road were most serious obstacles
to their progress. These roads, where pack trains of mules
travel, become crossed from side to side with alternate
ridges and hollows by the constant treading of the animals
in the same tracks. In strict keeping with the Brazilian
character, they follow in the footsteps of those who have
gone before, and nothing induces them to change their unvarying
adherence to the same track. Thus, one after another,
and four or five abreast in a broad road, lines are
formed entirely across, resembling when they become dry
the ridges formed for planting the sweet potato. Indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>this correspondence is so striking that the first instance
seen, being upon a road that had ceased to be travelled by
these troops of pack-mules, induced me to think that a crop
of potatoes or other roots had been planted there. Yet,
upon inquiry, I learned that these ridges resulted from the
very thing encountered on the road to-day, and by lapse of
time all signs of tracks had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our route the depressions were either full of water
and mud, or the slope at one side kept them drained; but
in either case it was difficult for the mules to step over the
high ridges, and one needs but to try the experiment of
stepping repeatedly over elevations of this kind to know
how tiresome it must prove to the animal when kept up for
some considerable time.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the hillsides the clay was for the most part solid,
and with a slight rain that was falling it was very slick,
which impeded our ascent; and our descent of these slick
smooth slopes was something very peculiar, and to me quite
amusing. The mules seemed to understand the thing perfectly,
and would glide down as boys descend a steep clay
bank upon a slide, making a continuous impression like the
trail of a small narrow slide upon the side of the hill, from
top to bottom. The two pack-mules were kept ahead, and
upon reaching the top of one of the hills, away they would
go one after the other, and as soon as they were out of the
way, then down went the animals of the camaradas, as if
upon skates, in quick succession, and going with that great
speed resulting from the declivity. At the outset, I felt
some concern as to following this example upon my staunch
and rather tall mule, hunting for a rough part of the ground
to descend so as to keep his feet from sliding. But I soon
found that it was better to let him go as the others did, and
when he would get under way on a long, steep hill, he went
down almost with the velocity of a locomotive-engine.</p>

<p class='c007'>These mules are without shoes, and indeed the best-secured
shoes would probably be lost in the stiff mud. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>hoof penetrates the clay in the soft parts of the road, and
when drawn out it pops at every step like a cupping-glass
jerked suddenly from the skin. Only one of the animals
made a complete fall during the day, and that was the horse,
which was running loose at the time. The mules frequently
slipped upon their knees in ascending the slick hills, but
were upon their feet again in an instant. These men give
their mules the rein entirely loose in descending the hills;
and though I felt like keeping a check upon my bridle at
first, I observed that the others got on better without
tightening their reins, and that the pack-mules went safely
without bridles, so that I soon concluded to give my brave
and sturdy mule his will, letting him select his own way
and his own speed in descending the hills.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we approached the crest of the serra, the route
became so very steep and rugged that, in compassion to my
faithful animal, I dismounted and walked up several hills.
The camaradas had previously on sundry occasions relieved
their animals by walking; and the old man got a
fall in going up a slick hill very much such as that which
occurred to the horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been a considerable amount of labor bestowed
upon this route across the serra, to make it practicable for
pack-mules and those under the saddle; yet it is very difficult
to make the trip even with excellent animals, and inferior
stock could not traverse this awful road.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am now entirely satisfied as to the cause of the cotton
and other freight going from Faxina and other neighboring
places, over the long route by way of São Paulo, to Santos
upon pack-mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulties of the passage across this serra may not
be so great elsewhere as the route by which I travelled to-day;
but from all that can be learned it is not likely that
communication will ever be made easy from that region to
the navigable waters of the Ribeiro de Ignape. Should
the same amount of labor be given to the line from Itapetininga
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>to Sette Barros which has been expended upon
the Serra de Santos, it is most likely that a practicable
road could be made there; and that route is perhaps the
most important of any that could be selected for the accommodation
of the public interests of the country. The
vast and very fertile region of Botocatu would find a ready
outlet for its products by this line of communication, and
the large tract of agricultural country lying between this
place and Apiahy calls loudly for a road to this river, over
which wagons as well as pack-mules may pass with facility.
A road to Sette Barros, or some point on the Rio Inquia,
would secure steamboat transportation, and redound to
the greatest benefit of the people throughout this entire
region, while it would promote vastly the interests of the
government. If the difference of freight by such a line,
and the long line of pack-mules to Santos, is considered, it
ought to induce prompt action in effecting it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In different parts of the serra, which is here known as the
“Morreo de Chumbo,” (hill of lead,) large mines of lead
ore have been discovered; and the large proportion of
metal and its freedom from impurities would insure an
abundant yield.</p>

<p class='c007'>Large masses of limestone are also present in several
places. In one place, iron ore was likewise observed, which
is doubtless connected with an extensive deposit. I was
particularly struck with collections of superior red chalk,
which would be well adapted for red pencils, as well as the
ordinary marking purposes of chalk, while it might also
serve as a pigment when ground. There is said also to be
a deposit of coal in the range of hills next to Iporanga,
but this may be a misapprehension of inexperienced persons.
Should there prove to be coal-mines here, the value
of the whole assemblage of mineralogical specimens would
be immensely enhanced.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these treasures might be made available which are
located upon slopes of the serra looking towards Iporanga,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>but on the other side the difficulties of transportation are
almost insurmountable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the top of the serra, between two ridges, there is a
farm, upon which corn was growing most luxuriantly.
Bananas and coffee trees were also seen at another place,
looking very well.</p>

<p class='c007'>An exceeding fine black bull was observed all alone far
up on the ridge, and his appearance indicated fine stock.
Other cattle in excellent condition were seen elsewhere,
and in one group there were four bulls, two of which were
very large.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We reposed last night at an old site of a fazenda, belonging
to the estate of Senor Rafael, who died about a year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>since leaving a large property. A negro woman, having
charge of the house, gave it up to our possession, and assisted
us some in our culinary arrangements, for which she
was rewarded by taking breakfast with these camaradas,
after I had eaten my frugal meal. The farina was made
into mush this morning, and thus furnished something of a
variety in our fare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having now descended from the elevated land, we proceeded
along a stream, called the Ribeirão de Camarga,
which was crossed no less than nine times within a few miles;
and after leaving it, three other smaller streams were crossed
within as many hundred yards, all converging to empty
into one channel that was subsequently passed, as it made
its way into the great receptacle of these waters, the Ribeira
de Ignape.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within six miles we reached the village of Iporanga, and
ascertaining that Senor João Paulo Dias, to whom I bore a
letter, was not in town, I called at his house, and found Senor
Joaquim José Vieyra da Rocha in possession, who treated
me very kindly. He provided a very good meal for me, and
yet having no knife on the table, left me to manage with a
fork and a spoon. Upon intimating my wish to arrange for
proceeding upon my journey, he went and brought Senor
Manoel Joquim da Rocha, who advised me to proceed to
Xiririca in a canoe, and arrange there for farther progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this I acceded, and requested him to make all the requisite
arrangements for the trip on the water, and let me
know what was to be paid. He stated that it would be
better for me to go this afternoon, some eight miles down
the river to the situ of Senor João Paulo, to whom I had
brought the letter, and spending the night with him, I could
resume my voyage to-morrow morning. All being in readiness,
he went with me to the point of embarkation, and upon
my proposing to pay, he said all was settled in advance, and
that I had nothing to pay. Besides this, he gave me two
letters to parties in Xiririca, to facilitate my progress from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>there. This gentleman being an entire stranger, and having
no personal interest whatever in serving me, I appreciated
most gratefully his kindness in this matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>I learned from Senor Manoel that Senor Street had been
here some days ago, but had returned to Cananea, and perhaps
to São Paulo; yet it was my expectation that he might
still be found at the former place, and my wish was to communicate
with him if possible in this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>In descending the river, my negro boatman told me that
the gentleman to whose house I was going was one of a
party in canoes at a landing near by us. I directed him to
stop his canoe at this place, and upon meeting Senor João
Paulo, the letter of Senor Joaquim Custodio Merada of
Paranapanema was delivered to him. He invited me to
return with him and his family to the town; but upon stating
to him my destination, he proposed at once to go back
with me to his situ below.</p>

<p class='c007'>I suggested to him that this would perhaps incommode
his family, but all seemed to acquiesce cheerfully, and returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>His cotton field was visited, and the land seemed to be
well adapted to the growth of this article; but the work was
very deficient, and the want of proper culture was indicated
in the large number of stalks that were allowed to remain in
a hill. In some instances, I counted as many as eight stalks
growing in close proximity to each other, and the hills generally
had more than three stalks. I advised him to reduce
the stand to two stalks in a place, for a portion at least of
his crop, that he might see the benefit of thinning it out. I
selected one stalk which happened to be alone, and counted
upon it twenty-two squares; and no stalks where there was
two or more in a place exceeded sixteen squares, thus illustrating
on the spot the advantage of more space.</p>

<p class='c007'>A portion of the plants on this place have been destroyed
by the ants, (formica,) and I suggested to him that the use
of the plough in planting and in the subsequent cultivation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of the cotton, would be likely to keep the soil free from the
ant:</p>

<p class='c007'>Another portion of the field was overrun with the weeds;
and even the hoe had not been used in any part of his cotton,
so as to afford a good result. A part of this land is river
bottom, but above ordinary inundations, while another part
is elevated land, running up from this flat, and it seemed
that the latter was the best suited to the production of cotton,
being also less liable to the attacks of the ant. This
low land would doubtless suit corn well, yet it is here as we
see all the world over, the article that is supposed to bring
most money has precedence; and no corn was seen, though
he stated that it was planted in some other portions of land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands lying along the river thus far are very hilly
and almost mountainous, with here and there, as at this
place, a level space in which cotton, corn, or sugar-cane is
planted. The more irregular lands are usually covered with
mandioca, the root of which is the great source of farina,
that is so generally used as food in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coffee trees were observed growing well in the yard at
this place, having a good crop of berries and abundant
blooms, where the berries were not yet formed. Senor João
informed me that coffee gives a good yield here, and that
there is no frost in this section to damage the crop.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a rice pounding-mill in operation adjoining the
dwelling, and it is expected to connect a cotton-gin with
the same water-power.</p>

<p class='c007'>As yet there are no cotton-gins in this region of country,
and any one who would anticipate the supply of the planters
by erecting machinery for cleaning and packing cotton upon
this river, would realize a fine return from his investment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor João gave me this evening a fine specimen of lead
ore, taken from a deposit within five miles of Iporanga; and
he says there is certainly a bed of coal in the same vicinity,
specimens of which he has sent to Rio de Janeiro, but no
report has yet been received from the examination of it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>He states that a good road can be made from the site of this
lead and coal to the river, and transportation in large canoes
thence to Xiririca, at which point the river becomes navigable
for steamboats.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large coal-mine here would be far more valuable than
a gold mine to the fortunate owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor João Paulo Dias is the delegado of police for the
municipality of Iporanga, and occupying a position in
society which entitles his statements and opinions to respect.
Upon inquiring the facts as to health and climate in
this locality and the adjacent country, he gives an unqualified
voucher for their salubrity and pleasantness. I see
nothing that could induce disease; and the atmosphere is
dry, with the sun shining all the day brightly, while the
elevation gives a more pleasant temperature than in lower
places, or even in the plateau lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am informed that none of these troublesome little insects
which penetrate the skin of the feet, and other parts,
are found here, and yet there are hogs constantly about
the yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>I learn here that the lands of Dom Prates, of which mention
was previously made, are located near the route from
Apiahy to Iporanga, and though hilly are considered fertile.
It is stated, however, that the coffee trees planted there
have all died, from some inscrutable cause. I am satisfied
that the land is very unfavorably located for transportation,
and shall not try to visit it under all the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The important matter in selecting a place is to secure
lands adapted to all the variety of products, which are exempt
from liability to sickness, and affording ready means
of communication with a market, by means of navigation.
Such I trust may be found combined in the neighborhood
of Xiririca; and without spending time looking at other
points I will proceed to investigate those lands.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Though this day should have been observed as a day of
rest, the arrangement of Senor Manoel made it incumbent
to proceed in his canoe down the river to-day. After
breakfasting with Senor João Paulo I was provided with a
supply of chicken, fish, etc., etc., for my dinner, and took
my departure at 9 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> The large fish, of which I
had a part, and had also partaken at breakfast, was caught
with a hook from the river, and though the name has
escaped me, it was a fine specimen of what these waters
produce. I understand that large fish are not so frequent
here as lower down in the stream, but that there are a
great many of good size for table use in all parts of the
river.</p>

<p class='c007'>While coming down in the canoe I read in the Portuguese
Testament the sixth chapter of St. John’s gospel, and
tried to profit by the lessons of dependence upon the Lord
which it inculcates.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early part of my descent the lands were quite
mountainous on each side of the river, but the irregularity
of the surface gradually became less, until I reached a
region where the elevations afforded only an agreeable
relief to the more uniform configuration of the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the corn seen in the first part of the voyage seemed
to have been planted early, and had become prematurely
dry, giving an unfavorable impression of the yield of this
region. But that observed lower down, and more recently
planted, looked fresh and vigorous, while the corn approaching
maturity was evidently of better stamina than
that passed above. This change was evident after descending
twenty miles, and decided after reaching the Inguary.
This small river enters opposite to a very pretty island,
which looks as if it would be productive; and the appearance
of the corn on each bank of the Ribeira indicated
good soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon descending further, the Laguary, a larger stream on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the left, was passed, and I was told that canoes ascend it to
a considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below this is the island of Bananal Grande.</p>

<p class='c007'>My sturdy negro boatman did not seem inclined to expend
much his energies upon his paddle, and I endeavored
to stimulate him by offering a reward for a quick trip.
But he subsequently sat down to paddle, and actually went
to sleep. I then said that he must be very tired, and proposed
to relieve him for a time, but he insisted there was
no need of my doing so, and seemed to turn over the paddle
to me reluctantly. My progress was not the most satisfactory,
and getting into a swift place, the canoe made headway
towards a point of land which I had to turn. The
negro, perceiving my inability to manage his craft, again
took the paddle, and after this there was no more sitting
down to sleep. These fellows stand up in using the paddle
or pole, and it is surprising how long they can continue
this severe labor without intermission. This canoe was a
regular dug-out, as are all on this river. It measured about
twenty (20) feet in length, two (2) feet across the mouth,
and eighteen (18) inches deep. The general thickness did
not exceed one inch, with a belt of increased thickness in
the middle, and with somewhat more substance in the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro informed me that such a canoe could be bought
for six dollars ($6.00) at Iporanga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaching Xiririca shortly after 6 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, I went
immediately to the house of Senor Miguel Antonio Jorgi,
and upon presenting the letters I bore from various parties,
he proposed that I should proceed with him and his family
down the river to his situ. To this I cordially assented,
saying, “En eston as suas ordens.” His wife was introduced
to me, and having learned that she spoke English, I
forthwith propounded the interrogatory, “Falla Inglez,
Senhora?” But I was answered, “Não, Senhor. Esquece
toda lingua Ingleza.” She had spoken English when she
was first married, but having no one to converse with for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>eight years, it had been forgotten, and I was left to my
small acquirements in Portuguese as the only means of
communication with this family. Senor Guilherme, a son
of Senor Miguel, was also presented to me, and a number
of other gentlemen who happened to be at the house when
I entered. I escorted Senhora to the canoe-landing, giving
her my arm, as I had learned this act of civility was viewed
much in the same light as with us. All that was said by
either was mutually understood, and my prospect for getting
on in my communications with intelligent, educated people,
is far more encouraging than in my intercourse with the
caipiras with whom I have been for several days past in
coming across the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was accommodated in the huge family canoe, which had
a covering of raw-hide, and all were comfortably protected
for the voyage of ten miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro with the other canoe, in charge of my baggage,
was directed by Senor Miguel to follow us.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Requesting Senor Guilherme to write a note of thanks
for me to Senor Manoel Joaquim da Rocha, for the service
rendered by the man and the canoe in bringing me down
the river, they were dismissed this morning at an early
hour to return to Iporanga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having learned definitely that Senor Street has left this
section, I am thrown upon my own resources in making any
exploration of the lands, and, as Senor Miguel seems very
kindly disposed, I have accepted his invitation to remain a
few days for the purpose of looking around the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>His dwelling and all its appliances present an air of substantial
comfort, and even of elegance in some respects.
The parlor is a large, well-furnished apartment, and has a
piano of the bureau order, which is very fashionable in this
country. His wife performs well upon this instrument, and
has also the accomplishment of speaking French and Italian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>though she has forgotten most of her English. She is very
sprightly, and appears quite young for the wife of a gentleman
of fifty-five years, as I take Senor Miguel to be from
his appearance. He is originally from Spain and retains
much of the harsh accent of that country in speaking the
Portuguese, so that I do not understand him with the same
facility as I do his wife or his son. The only fruit of the
present marriage is one pretty little girl, who is quite a
prattler. By a former marriage he has this son and two
others, one a lawyer at Ignape, and the other a Catholic
priest at Bahia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Miguel has at this place extensive machinery with
water-power, for treating rice and sugar-cane, from the latter
of which the rum (cachaça) is the chief yield, as it is
found to pay better than the sugar or molasses.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was struck with the convenience of his rolling scaffolds
for sunning the rice, there being three or four of different
elevations, so that one goes under the other, and each having
its separate track, they can be compactly stored under a
house or drawn out to be exposed to the sun. A similar
plan to this would be well suited for drying coffee, yet
nothing of the kind was seen in the coffee establishments,
and they should profit by the suggestion. Upon these a
few of the women and children about the house can draw
out or run under shelter, as may be required, a large amount
of rice or coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is also a saw-mill in operation here which seems to
be of long standing, and has a perpendicular saw that works
rather slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The water-power used for these several purposes is a
stream of no great magnitude, that comes into the Ribeira
at this point, and by throwing a dam across some short
distance above, he secures sufficient water for his purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The residence and other buildings are located upon the
bank of the river within a short distance of the water, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>sundry large canoes supply the means of transportation to
and from this place, which is called Caiacauga.</p>

<p class='c007'>These canoes are of various sizes, made out of a solid log
of wood. The one in which we all came down last night is
forty-five feet long, thirty-two inches deep and thirty inches
across the mouth. But there are others larger than this in
all respects, and some measuring three feet across the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest canoes will carry ten thousand pounds of
freight upon this river, and are worth about one hundred
dollars; those of eight thousand pounds capacity may be
bought for ninety dollars; while those of five thousand
pounds capacity are valued at fifty dollars. From this down
to the size capable of carrying two men and their baggage,
the price ranges even as low as five dollars. This is found
to be a very economical means of transportation, and those
who employ their canoes for the public charge but twenty
cents per head from Xiririca to Ignape, a distance of between
ninety and one hundred miles. The steamboats
adopt the same scale of rates; and from Ignape to Rio de
Janeiro the rate of transportation is forty cents per head,
making the entire freight from Xiririca to Rio de Janeiro
only sixty cents per head when transported by water.</p>

<p class='c007'>In comparing this with the table of published rates from
Santos to Rio Claro, or any of the interior towns in the direction
of Araraquara, it is found the latter is two dollars
and forty cents per head without including the further item
of shipment to Rio de Janeiro from Santos. So much for
the difference of water and pack-mule transportation. We
may reasonably calculate that the transportation to Rio
from Araraquara will be five-fold greater than from Xiririca,
even when the line of railroad is completed from Santos to
Campinas. The pack-mules being placed on the upper part
of the line will continue to exact a heavy tariff before articles
reach the cars, and the rate of freight by railroad must
exceed very much that by water.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>This matter is of great consequence in the profits of a
crop; and while many articles are entirely precluded from
market, by the rates of transportation on pack-mules from
the interior of this province, even coffee and cotton cannot
be forwarded to any advantage, except when the prices of
these commodities are very high. On the other hand, there
is scarcely any thing marketable which could not afford to
pay the freight from Xiririca and leave a margin of profit;
and all that is saved upon coffee and cotton is clear gain to
the planter in this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ribeira de Ignape is navigable for steamboats of
light draught at all seasons up to Xiririca, and at the ordinary
state of the water, during the rainy season, those
drawing eight feet can pass up it. The part affording least
depth of water is at the mouth, all other parts of the river,
being very favorable for navigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It runs very smoothly opposite the site of Caiacauga;
and in passing down a few miles this afternoon, I was impressed
with its special adaptation for navigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I visited, in company with Senor Miguel, the farm of
Senor Manoel Roberto de Almaida, about two miles down
the river; and though being under cultivation, it interested
me greatly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cotton of American seed had been growing four years
without pruning, and yielded two crops a year. The present
prospect for a crop is fair, and I counted an average stalk
having forty-two grown bolls upon it, while an isolated stalk
had eighty-five bolls. I saw a very large stalk of cotton
separate from the planting of the field, where it had ample
space to spread, which must have had, at the least calculation,
two hundred bolls.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the first specimen seen which has been growing
for such a length of time, and it has not even been cut off,
as most of the plants have been, which are more than one
year’s growth. The appropriateness of this climate for the
continuous production of cotton from a single planting during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>four years, is illustrated by a considerable field growing
in this place; and apart from being arranged in rows, it
affords but little evidence of attention. The land is evidently
inferior to most of the surrounding territory, and
yet it is of that dark gray order, with an admixture of coarse
gravel, that is usually best adapted to the culture of cotton.
The recently planted cotton also looks well, and if it was
cultivated properly, would doubtless far exceed the yield of
that which has been on the land four years.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Coffee trees of great age were seen here still bearing some
fruit, and younger trees, with a full crop of the berries, indicated
a climate well suited to this article. This man is
eighty-five years old, and has a sister ninety years old living
in this neighborhood, giving good evidence of the healthfulness
of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>I came down the river this morning in a canoe with Senor
Miguel and his son, to his plantation at Ponto-Grosso, a
distance of forty miles from Caiacauga. The rain was falling
most of the time of our descent, and prevented me from
seeing much of the land or crops on either side of the river.
The few patches of corn seen did not present a favorable
aspect, but having no information as to the period of its
planting, I could not judge correctly of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We landed at a sandy beach, and breakfasted upon the
abundant supplies brought with us; and dined after our arrival,
having taken eight hours to make the trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rio Inquia enters the Ribeira eight miles above here,
and adds greatly to the amount of water, so that it bears a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>striking resemblance to the Mississippi river, in the character
of the stream and the general aspects of the adjacent
country. It is a magnificent body of water, and, with the
exception of a single small steamboat, is only navigated
by large canoes, which transport the products along its
margin to Ignape, a distance of forty miles below this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lands along the banks of this river are covered for
the most part with a most luxuriant growth of the copine
grass, which is relished greatly by cattle, horses, and mules;
but it is so succulent that it does not seem well for drying
so as to make hay, and the land is too valuable to be left
open for pasturage, so that very little of it is made available.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soil of the river bottoms is a dark ash color, of a fine
loamy consistence, and of great depth, so that it does not
become exhausted by cultivation; and corresponds (so far
as my limited knowledge of the lands of the Mississippi
enable me to speak) very much in all respects to the Mississippi
bottoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon visiting a field where cotton and corn are planted,
the former was found to be growing too luxuriantly, and
will be likely to make a large stalk without affording a
good yield. The stand was irregular, and had been but
partially supplied by replanting and transplanting. This
last process is entirely new to me, and though not resorted
to in the Southern States, it has a fair prospect for success
here in the rainy season. The importance of having the
stand of cotton all as nearly of the same age as practicable,
and getting it forward during the wet months, will warrant
the trouble, if it is found to succeed well. It is demonstrated
that the plant takes root and grows, but how it
may thrive or yield subsequently is yet to be tested. It
has not been tried by any other person who I have met
in Brazil, and has been resorted to in compliance with a
suggestion of Dom Frederico Leopoldo Cesar Burlamaqui,
a writer upon the culture of cotton, whose paper was published
in 1863, with a view to induce the planters of Brazil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>to plant cotton while its culture was suspended in the
United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The corn is planted in rows, with five rows of cotton
intervening, and consequently too far apart for the pollen
from the tassels to have its full effect upon the silks. The
ears are therefore not well filled with grains, and the
general size of the ears do not seem in proportion to the
large stalks. The white flint corn is planted here exclusively,
and the same seed has been used from time immemorial,
so that a change of the grain is perhaps now
indicated for the improvement of the crop. Of course the
corn ought to be planted separate from the cotton, and the
rows being in closer proximity would secure a better result.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been a change made in the rice planted here,
within the last three years, and the superior quality of the
yield over that of other specimens is very evident. A part
of the new supply was from Santos, which is regarded an
excellent place for rice; and another portion was procured
from South Carolina, the rice from that State being considered
the best of the world. Senor Miguel tells me the
seed of the Carolina rice yields more grains to the head,
but not larger or better quality than the other. The rice
culture here is not confined to low lands, but is mixed with
corn and cotton by some persons in uplands. My friend
has at this place a rice-mill in operation, with a dozen
mortars and pestles, and cleans ten sacks of rice daily.
This is a task assigned to those working in the establishment,
and they have to complete it before stopping the
mill. It requires it to go quite early, and continues until
after night, to accomplish the whole process.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Wednesday</span>, <i>January 10, 1866</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We set out this morning before breakfast and visited a
field of corn which was approaching the period of tasseling,
and presented a vigorous growth, though too much
crowded in the drill.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>A coffee field was next examined, containing twenty-five
thousand (25,000) trees of two years and younger which
had been transferred from a nursery. They were evidently
retarded in their development by a luxuriant crop of mandioca
that surrounded the plants and shut out the sun to a
great extent; yet the most of them look in a healthy,
thriving condition, and some have blooms or a few berries
of coffee. This coffee is planted upon elevated land, and
the soil is dark gray with a mulatto base. These conical-shaped
elevations are frequently observed here, and stand
out in bold relief to the general flat character of the land
near the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mandioca presents an appearance very similar to the
castor oil plant when fully developed; and the root is the
great source of farina which is eaten by whites and blacks
throughout Brazil. There are two distinct varieties, one of
which is very similar to the sweet potato, being eaten in
the same mode; while the other contains a poisonous juice
which must be expressed from the root before the solid portion
is used for food. This juice is said to be fatal to man
or animal if taken in any considerable quantity; and the
presence of it to a greater or less extent in some specimens
of the farina is doubtless prejudicial to health, and
may perhaps be a source of leprosy in some instances elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farina, however, when properly prepared from this
poisonous root, is found to be nutritious and healthy; and
this variety of the mandioca supplies most of the people
with a substitute for bread. The roots are scraped and
grated by a machine, when the coarse powder is subjected
to compression under a screw to express the juice, after
which the solid portion is pounded in a mortar until reduced
to a fine powder. This is then dried in shallow pans
over a furnace, and undergoes a cooking or parching process
that fits it for keeping in sacks or barrels for any
length of time. It is generally put on the table in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>dry state, and is mixed with almost every thing else that
may be eaten, in the same manner that we use bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this, there is also a beautifully fine and white
powder made from the mandioca by a process similar to
that of preparing starch; and it is used for diet under the
same circumstances that arrow-root is employed with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mandioca grows well upon this land, and yields
without culture, but should be allowed to remain in the
ground from eighteen months to two years to attain maturity.</p>

<p class='c007'>One stalk, which was torn out of the ground this morning
for me to examine the roots, had twenty developments
resembling sweet potatoes, and the whole would have filled
a peck measure, thus affording a most abundant yield. It
is propagated by cuttings from the limbs of the growing
plants, and these are planted so that the trees cover the
entire land densely and uniformly.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfasting, the extensive new ground (roça) was
visited. One hundred and sixty (160) acres planted in
cotton and twenty acres in corn and rice present quite a
promising prospect, though as yet nothing definite can be
determined as to the result. The cotton is all young, but
the most advanced looks well, notwithstanding there is in
some parts a considerable admixture of fern and poke-stalks,
calling for the hoe, and the dead trees are lying promiscuously
over the ground. There has been an attempt
to plant in rows, but they are very irregular; and the stand
of cotton is in many places deficient, though it does not seem
to be the result of destruction by the ant as in other places.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the work here is done with the hoe; and the planting
is effected by digging a hoeful of dirt, dropping five or six
seed, and then covering, at intervals of two feet, more or
less.</p>

<p class='c007'>This land is elevated and the soil dark gray, with an admixture
of sand, presenting very favorable conditions for
cotton if the culture was properly conducted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The corn was yet young but flourishing, and is expected
to yield without farther work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rice is planted in the flats between the more elevated
grounds, and evidently will give an excellent yield.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pine-apples were found growing promiscuously in different
parts of this plantation, and I had the opportunity of
eating this most delicious fruit to my complete satisfaction;
and we started back with our canoe well stocked
with large, yellow, sweet-scented cones.</p>

<p class='c007'>In returning I observed the settlements more than in
descending, as it was no longer raining, and there was a
large number of dwellings on the margin of the Ribeiro,
having in many instances a rice-mill connected with the
establishment. These mills are moved usually by small
streams of water coming into the river from either side;
and a prime object in locating a residence is to be near one
of these streams.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the place where we stopped to eat our cold dinner,
called Esterão da Pedro, a pretty article of farina was
made from the rice, and Senor Miguel tells me the same is
prepared at his house.</p>

<p class='c007'>This article is used in its simple state or prepared in
different forms of bread. It is likewise used as a powder
for the skin, and relieves irritation of the surface in this
warm climate. The rice is largely used by all those people
along the banks of the Ribeiro, and with fish constitutes
most of the food of many of the inhabitants. To this
mode of living is attributed the swarthy, lean, and haggard
look of the population in many places we passed; but
there is little doubt of the local influence from the lowlands
adjacent to the river having much to do in causing this impoverished
and sickly appearance of men, women, and children.
All parties concur with Senor Miguel in stating that
there are but few cases of disease of any kind in this region;
yet there is a want of stamina in the constitutional
structure that indicates something unfavorable to health,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>and I should not like a location so low down on the river,
or so immediately upon its margin.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Not being able to make the return trip, we stopped for the
night at the house of Senor Bento José de Morais, and spreading
our bedding upon the floor, remained until this morning.
Taking a cup of coffee, we resumed our ascent of the river at
an early hour. The notable rock of the horse (Pedra de
Cavallo) soon came into view, and being on the dividing
line between Xiririca and Ignape, is a point of some interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>It stands in the middle of the river and is supposed to
bear a resemblance to a horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stopping at a house upon the bank of the river to eat the
supplies brought along for our breakfast, a clean place could
scarcely be found to spread our table-cloth. Senor Miguel
proposed to the occupants to remove some things from a
table for our use, and such a nest of cock-roaches as was
broken up by the proceeding has rarely been seen in a private
dwelling.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the mahogany-backs were scampering off in all directions,
my friend gave me a significant look, and when
an opportunity presented, spoke his opinion of the slovenliness
and laziness of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were joined at the place where we spent the night by
Senor José Antonio de Silva, who has a small place above
Xiririca, and he states that the average crop of coffee from
his trees is eight (8) pounds per tree, and that he has
gathered from one isolated tree as much as thirty-two (32)
pounds in one year. He says the crop in that neighborhood
is sure and of good quality.</p>

<p class='c007'>It rained heavily during the afternoon, but we were thoroughly
protected by a covering of raw-hides.</p>

<p class='c007'>After enjoying a comfortable night in the hospitable mansion
of my friend, Senor Miguel, I went this morning with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>his son to set a gill-net for fish, and thence across the river
to gather some grapes. This planting is made from cuttings
of vines in the United States, and is now bearing a crop of
fine fruit. The vines are arranged upon a large wooden
frame, and appear vigorous and healthy, though upon the
low land near the river, which is certainly not a very favorable
site for the grape culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>That celestial fruit, the jaboticaba, was also found growing
in the same locality, but only a few remained of the
abundant crop which the trees are said to have borne this
year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several other varieties of fruit trees were seen, but it not
being the season of maturing, I had no opportunity to test
their qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>On returning to the gill-net quite a number of small fish
were entangled in its meshes, and Senor Guilherme has
since visited it again, getting quite a full mess for the entire
family. Some of them, called cascudo, are a new order
of fish to me, having a hard skin with scales like the pike
or gar, and a very large broad fin upon the back, spreading
out like a fan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was shining brightly during our walk, but it subsequently
clouded up and rained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Miguel showed me this afternoon a field in which
cotton and sugar-cane had been planted together, the crop
of cotton being gathered some months ago, and the cane
being now cut so as to permit the cotton to make another
crop from the old stalk.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All things being provided for a tour of observation, Senor
Miguel, his son Guilherme and myself embarked in a large
canoe at 9 o’clock this morning, to ascend the Ribeira.
The margin of the river on the way to Xiririca presented
many desirable locations which I had not been able to see
when coming down in the night. A short stop was made
at the village, where a letter was delivered to Senor Bernardo
José Cabral, that should have been presented on my
first arrival. Other letters were left for parties who were
not at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>On resuming our ascent of the river, a short visit was
made to the farm of Senor Francisco Alvares da Silva, where
his interesting family received us cordially, and one of his
daughters gave us several pieces of music on the piano.
He regaled us with excellent grapes of various qualities,
the germs of which were imported from the United States.
A few stalks of cotton from American seed were growing
finely in his yard. But I was most interested in his coffee
field, where trees from three years to twenty years growth
presented a most exuberant crop of berries, and certainly
present as good a prospect for a large yield of coffee as any
of the trees seen in the best regions of Campinas, Lemeira
and Rio Claro. These trees are growing in a sandy soil,
upon a high bank of the river, and there is an excellent crop
of corn in the intervening space, with good cane adjoining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our progress up the river enabled me to see again the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>lands on the banks, which had been seen in my first descent,
and further observation impressed me even more favorably.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many places there are hills extending to the margin,
but in most parts the land is elevated, with an extended
plain, looking as if the soil would be admirably adapted to
cultivation. Corn, rice and sugar-cane, with occasional
small patches of coffee, were observed in different localities,
and this region seems not only well suited to a variety of
products, but also is admirably adapted for settlement. It
is high, and gives evidence of being healthy in the appearance
of the people living upon the margin of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have seen nowhere better specimens of healthy, vigorous
development than was presented by the daughters of
the gentleman at whose house we stopped, and the report
given is unqualifiedly favorable to the healthiness of the
country and the pleasantness of the climate. Though in
the rainy season there is frequently wet weather for a few
days, yet even during this period there are intervals of
clear, bright days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun shone brightly upon us during most of the day,
and though there was a mere sprinkle late in the afternoon,
it soon passed off and the sky was again free from cloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>The current, after ascending a short distance from Xiririca,
becomes more rapid, and though we had four stout negroes
to man our large canoe, it gave them heavy labor in using
the poles. Upon making the suggestion that it was severe
work, the reply was simply that they were used to it and
did not tire.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was after dark when we reached the mouth of the
Inguary, and this being the point of disembarkation, we
stopped at a house for the night.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Again, my dependence upon the arrangements of others
induced a departure from the proper observance of the Sabbath.
The night had been spent very comfortably, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>assistance of bedding brought in the canoe; and, though I
slept in an open shed or piazza, I was not annoyed either by
the bite or buzzing of mosquitoes; which gives a promise of
exemption here from this troublesome tenant of the forests.
The temperature at this point, which is twelve miles above
Xiririca, is most delightful; and I am reminded of the remark
of General Waddy Thompson, in regard to the table lands
of Mexico, that a person having a coat would not care to
take it off, or if it was removed, he would not care to put it
on again. It is that genial state of the atmosphere which
renders a person quite satisfied with his situation. With
the majestic Ribeira flowing at our feet, and the beautiful
island, to which allusion was made in my descent from Iporanga,
lying immediately opposite our place of lodging, relieved
by a green background of luxuriant corn upon the
other side of the water, this pleasant spot held out encouragement
for a thorough examination of the adjacent country.
The soil near the bank of the river is a dark loamy earth,
that gives every indication of fertility. A field of corn and
also a patch of sugar-cane were seen growing near our
quarters, and presented a very flourishing condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negroes at the place said there had been a small space
planted in cotton, but that the weeds and grass had overgrown
it, so that it was abandoned. Upon asking why they
did not work it better, they seemed to regard it as too troublesome
to cultivate, saying “Não da lucro,” (it does not
give profit.) So much for their knowledge of the value of
cotton. A small specimen of cotton from a neighboring
farm was brought for inspection, which looked as if it might
have been produced under the same sort of disadvantages
which induced the other to be abandoned, and gave a very
unfavorable impression of the cotton culture in this part of
the country. The land, however, is evidently well suited to
the growth of cotton, when it may receive proper attention,
and fine crops have been seen both above and below this
point.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The animals which had been sent from Caiacauga across
the country arrived here this morning, and all the preliminary
steps were taken for proceeding into the woods. Two
pack-mules were loaded with bedding, cooking-utensils and
supplies of various kinds; yet there were sundry articles to
be carried by the negroes, and among them a huge tin box
having cooked provisions, plates, tumblers, spoons, knives
and forks, &#38;c., &#38;c. I was surprised to see that even two
wooden forks and a pole were to be carried, for suspending
a hammock at night, especially as our expected tour lay
through forests, where these things could be got when we
stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seven negro men and one negro woman (as a cook) accompanied
us, to subserve the various objects connected
with the examination of the lands and the care of the stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before starting, we were joined by Senor Bernardo Antonio
de Ramos Moraes, who is the owner of the small
house at which we quartered, and resides a mile distant from
the river. He has here a large body of land, and another
party adjoining him below has a considerable tract lying on
the river, both of which will be sold, if it is thought desirable
to secure a body of land in this locality, extending to
the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stream, known as Ribeirão Inguary, which enters the
Ribeira de Ignape at this point, passes through the lands
of the above-named party, and at a short distance, perhaps
half a mile, from the Ribeira, there is a fall in its channel,
that would afford a very good site for any machinery that
might be desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>After passing through this land, we entered a body of
land owned by Senor Miguel, and encountered at the outset
quite a hilly region, a part of which has formerly been cultivated,
and is now covered with a second growth, (capoeira,)
while there is at our place a field of fine corn, which indicates
quite a productive soil. This land is of a dark gray
aspect, with some large gravel, and would certainly yield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>cotton advantageously, even where it has been once cultivated
with the hoe only and turned out. There is adjoining
this territory, and lying in an angle between two of its extensions,
a portion of land occupied by a number of small
farmers, who live in close proximity to each other, having
the ordinary thatched houses of the country. If these can
be secured on reasonable terms, the houses might form the
nucleus for a settlement, and they are not more than three
or four miles from the river, with a very fair road.</p>

<p class='c007'>After passing this populated valley, we traversed some
lands belonging to Senor José Alves de Moraes, which still
lay irregularly, and the soil assuming more of a yellow aspect,
while the growth of the palmetto was intermixed with
the large forest trees to a considerable extent. On this
place there was seen a small patch of coffee trees, three
years old, heavily laden with berries; and, though the soil
was rather sandy, it seemed to be favorable to the growth
of the coffee. It is certain that nowhere else have trees
of the same age presented a more favorable prospect for a
yield of fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving this, we again entered the territory of Senor
Miguel, at a part where the configuration is more regular,
and approaches in many places a level surface. It is an
undulating plain, with slopes here and there of more or less
abruptness; and having plateaus of elevated level land, and
also flat low lands which lie along the stream, Aborbora,
which runs through this land. Besides this stream, there
are other smaller branches running into it, which serve to
water all parts of the tract. But there is not any site, which
was seen on this portion of the territory, that would be
adapted to the use of water-power for machinery, and the
reliance for this region must be upon the water-power of
the Inguary lying between it and the port of shipment for
products.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quality of these lands varies greatly, presenting in
parts great fertility, and in others evidently of less adaptation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to the growth of the great staples of the country;
while there is occasionally a small portion of land that
seems to have been to a great extent exhausted by cultivation
in by-gone years, and is overgrown with a long grass,
corresponding to our broom-sage grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proportion of virgin forest and second growth could
not be accurately ascertained, but my impression is, that
three-fourths of the territory has never been entered by the
axe; and in this, the Pon D’Alho and Figaro Branco are of
frequent occurrence, which are here considered as indicative
of the best soil. The timber is not of that enormous dimension
which was observed in some parts of the interior, nor
do I consider any portion of this land equal in fertility and
durability to the (terra rocha) dark purple lands of the inferior
of the province. Yet the soil and the growth upon
it are well adapted to the purposes of the agriculturist, and
the facility for machinery, with the convenience of navigation,
are matters of much moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>I saw young corn on a portion of the tract of Senor
Miguel, last described, which presented a good appearance,
and also rice growing in upland that looked very favorable.
Some older corn examined did not impress me as a good
crop, though there was evidence of want of proper culture.
The beans had evidently not yielded well, and it was stated
that the time of planting by the tenants was improper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having spent the night at the house of one of the tenants
of this property, immediately upon the bank of a small
stream known as Aborbora, it was found that we were not
entirely exempt from mosquitoes, as on the night before,
yet they gave us no trouble in the house whatever. This
stream is one of the branches that go to make up the Rio
Jacupiranga, and its name is applied to this territory, supposed
to embrace two square leagues of land, owned by Senor
Miguel.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>In leaving this house we ascended a short abrupt hill,
and reached an elevated plain which extended with only
one depression for half a mile, being in part covered with
original forest, and presenting a dark mulatto soil. A portion,
which was cleared, had an excellent crop of rice growing
upon it, though there were low lands in the vicinity
which would probably have suited this article better; and
this want of judgment in arranging crops seems to be general
among the people of the class that become tenants in
this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>After passing this level region the land became hilly and
even mountainous at one point, making the ascent and descent
difficult for our animals. The soil upon these hills
was inclined to a clay consistence of a yellow hue, while
the increase of the palmetto and scrubby palm indicated
an inferior quality of land. Yet, upon a slope of one of
these hills, corn was growing well in fresh land, while it
was looking badly in old land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a small creek called Ribeirão de Lagoa, a low, flat,
dark-colored bottom land spread out to some distance on
either side, and the corn seen upon it indicated a good soil.
This stream would admit of machinery, and there is sufficient
fall near the point where it was crossed to render the
water-power available. It is clear and cool, so that we enjoyed
a draught of the water as much as if from a spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>The house of another tenant was located near this stream,
and he had a small patch of coffee trees, that seemed to
have been neglected, presenting a very untoward prospect
for a crop. The position being low, is doubtless likewise an
unfavorable condition, while the soil is not here suited to
their growth, being deficient in stamina.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this place was seen a hedge of a scrubby, knotty tree
with numerous short, thick limbs that seemed well suited
to exclude even hogs from a field; and, as it grows from the
cutting, an enclosure can be readily effected in a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is also another small tree having thorns that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>used for hedges, and the enclosure so made is called “cerca
de espinhos,” making an effectual barrier.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although these and other growths are available for enclosure
of grounds, hedges are not very often resorted to
in the country; and in the campos where the timber is
wanting, large ditches are made at a great expenditure of
labor, whereas a hedge could be grown to answer every
purpose when only cattle and horses or mules are to be enclosed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this region of country, however, there is an abundant
supply of timber, and the only difficulty is to find that which
is favorable for splitting into rails.</p>

<p class='c007'>After traversing the premises of another party, that contained
the poorest specimen of land seen since leaving the
river, we proceeded to an extension of the territory of Senor
Miguel, which goes within four miles of the town of Xiririca.
There corn and rice were growing very satisfactorily, and
though most of the land lay unfavorably for cultivation,
those parts that are cleared have a comparatively level surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near this portion of the land a field of coffee, on the
premises of another party, presented a very encouraging
prospect for a yield, being generally loaded heavily with
fruit. This was upon a steep hillside from which the superficial
soil had disappeared, and the mulatto clay formation,
which forms the basis of most parts throughout this region,
remained alone to support the growth of the trees. These
elevated lands are thought to be most favorable to the coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this point we retraced our steps for a few miles,
and then descended a stream called Braço de Gado for six
or seven miles along a low, flat, and broad bottom land,
having elevated lands on each side. A tenant occupies a
house where we entered this territory, and there is near by
an extensive fall in the stream above-named, which would
be available for an overshot wheel of any desired size.</p>

<p class='c007'>This point is particularly suitable for the location of machinery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>as it is but four miles from Xiririca, with a road
already in use which could be readily made to serve for
wagons. It is, besides, near the direct line of communication
between this place and Cananea.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the Braço de Gado several small streams
enter from each side, affording water for the several humble
families who occupy houses at different points by the favor
of the owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ridges upon each side, approaching a mountainous
elevation, constitute the boundary lines of this property;
and the breadth varies from three to four miles, while the
length is considered to be six miles. The slopes of the
hills on each side admit for the most part of ready cultivation;
and the soil being of a dark gray aspect with a
mulatto clay base, is adapted to all the staples, yet the
most irregular portions would be most appropriately used
for coffee. I saw good corn growing far up on the side of
one of these slopes, and corn and rice were also seen upon
the level plain below, but was too young to determine what
would be the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>This low land is generally level, and yet is not at all
marshy, as the stream has a deep channel below the surface
of the ground with abrupt angular banks, so that the
water does not overflow except in immense falls of rain
causing a flood of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earth is solid throughout this bottom, and the road
firm and good, except at the crossings of some of the small
branches. With very little work a fine wagon-road could
be made extending along this stream on a level route,
communicating above with the road to Xiririca, or extending
below some four or five miles over the same kind of
surface to the Rio Jacupiranga, which is navigable with the
largest canoes thence to its mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>We spent the night at the house of a mulatto man named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Senor Bartholomew da Costa; and having a heavy rain,
the Braço de Gado was so full this morning that it could
not be forded without swimming. Notwithstanding this
flood of water, there were very few points at which it overflowed
the high banks, and yet it did not fall sufficiently
during the day for us to cross it, so that we remained at
this place observing what was to be seen about the premises
of this gentleman of color.</p>

<p class='c007'>A patch of coffee, having some two thousand trees, was
examined, which afforded a poor prospect of a yield. This
was, in part, perhaps, attributable to being planted with a
southern exposure, instead of facing towards the east; yet
it is most likely that the soil is deficient in those elements
suited to the production of coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corn and rice were growing well in the flat land along the
stream, but most of it was too young to form a proper
opinion as to the yield. Observing that the rice was missing
in various places, I was told by the owner that it had
been eaten by rats which live in the woods, of whose voracity
there is no reason to doubt; though this is the first
time that these rats have been heard of in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here it was observed that the cows were very much annoyed
by a fly which deposits its egg in the flesh and causes
numerous points of irritation in the skin. The same result
ensues when they make a deposit in the human skin.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Finding the Braço de Gado reduced again to its natural
channel, we left our imprisonment, enjoying another day as
bright and clear as that of yesterday, until late in the
afternoon, when there was a slight shower of rain. This
body of land is the possession of Senor Miguel, and we
proceeded from it across the ridge towards the Ribeiro to
examine another tract owned by him, of a configuration
and quality that is better suited to agricultural operations
than any of the territory thus far seen. There is perhaps
a square league of land in this lot; and it combines original
forest, secondary growth, and open cultivated fields. A
large portion of the original forest is well timbered, and
not so irregular as to prevent cultivation with the plough;
but there is one part that assumes a mountainous character
and of course precludes ordinary culture. On the crest
of this elevation I was informed that crops had been grown
and that the soil was good, but I did not make the ascent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the lands under cultivation I saw a few patches of
corn, some of which was growing well, while others indicated
an exhausted soil as well as deficient culture. At
one small house where we stopped there were rice and peas,
which the negro tenant had grown on the place; and at
another there was a considerable lot of corn. There is
upon this place a site where a large rice-mill was formerly
in operation, and might be made available again for machinery.
I found the effects of the fly upon the skin of
cattle here also, and any quantity of mosquitoes in the
wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a tour of five days and a return to the comforts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>home, Senor Miguel announced this as a day of rest for us;
but a few points may be adverted to in connection with my
past observations upon the surroundings of this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>This section of country about Xiririca is exempt from local
or epidemic diseases, and the general constitutional stamina
of the population indicates vigorous health. Goitre and
leprosy, which are found in most other sections, are unknown
in this region. The climate is free from that oppressive
heat which prevails in higher latitudes, and which is observed
in less elevated localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The atmosphere is also free from fogs or any other undue
dampness. I am here in what is known to be the rainy
season of this country, and setting out from the homestead
of Senor Miguel Antonio Jorge on Saturday, the 13th inst.,
we ascended the Ribeira de Ignape for twenty-five miles,
and during the entire day the sun was shining brightly,
and only a mere sprinkle late in the evening for a few moments.
On the following day we crossed the range of hills
at right angles from the river, proceeding some eight or
ten miles, and again the sun shone brightly all the day
without any thing more than a light sprinkle late in the afternoon.
On the third day we traversed hills and valleys on
a line parallel with the Ribeira for a distance of fifteen
miles, and still the sun shone brightly throughout the day
with no signs of rain until night. On the fourth day the
sun beamed forth again, and the brightness of the fifth was
only marred by a sprinkle in the evening.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>My friend Senor Miguel Antonio Jorge arranged that
his son, Senor Guilherme, should accompany me to-day to
visit the lands lying between our former route and the
river. Setting out with a guide from Caiacauga, we proceeded
nearly four miles upon the road by which we returned
from our former tour, and then diverging to the
right hand, we passed through a portion of land lying favorably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and with good soil. This is located upon a stream
which forms the line of division between the territory which
Senor Miguel proposes to sell and that of his home place.</p>

<p class='c007'>This stream further up has a good site for machinery,
which is located upon lands of Senor João Franco, that will
be disposed of if they are desired. This point would serve
a good purpose in regard to much of the land, which is best
suited for agricultural operations, yet it is six or eight miles
from the Ribeira, upon which shipment must be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a view to accommodate the products of these lands,
Senor Miguel proposes to donate land for a depot on the
river below his residence, to which point there is a practicable
route for a road, which is now in use.</p>

<p class='c007'>After passing the mill site to which allusion is above
made, we ascended a very steep mountain, and the descent
was equally steep on the other side, so that this soil, though
presenting a favorable aspect, is not likely to be in requisition
for cultivation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving this elevation we visited a coffee field of Senor
Francisco de Paula, upon the slope of a high hill. The trees
were generally about six years growth, and consequently at
that age when the yield should be best, yet the crop was by
no means good, while the size and appearance of the trees
was unfavorable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether the nature of the soil or the manner of planting
may be the cause of the failure, I could form no definite
opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately at the villa of Xiririca a field of coffee, with
fifteen thousand trees, belonging to Senor João Franco,
gave a much more encouraging prospect for the culture of
coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>These trees are for the most part four years old, and
while larger and healthy, they were loaded heavily with
fruit, presenting by far the most favorable aspect of any
trees of the same age that have been seen anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here seems also to be an exception in the growth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>coffee tree upon the level plain near the river, and although
the bluff is high, so that there is never an overflow of this
land, yet it is what is usually denominated as bottom land
with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been alleged that in this whole region of country,
the coffee plant does not bear but a few years, when it declines,
or even dies.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the ground adjoining these trees, some antiquated
trees, supposed to be fifty years old, are still standing,
without any special indication of decay, and I have seen
elsewhere very old trees bearing fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seems nothing in the nature of the soil, or the character
of the climate throughout this region, to preclude the
proper growth of coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our route to-day several fields of corn were passed,
which presented a fine prospect for a yield, and especially
did the crops of corn look well near the road as we approached
the villa. I am not fully prepared to give an
opinion as to the result, from simply seeing a vigorous
stalk, before the ears are formed, but enough of the crop is
now earing to afford a guarantee of a good yield, and with
improved culture, corn will most assuredly turn out well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road leading into the villa from the lands previously
visited had been reached by us before, some four miles from
the villa, and now the exploration of it was continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>The route upon which the road is located is very favorable
for the construction of a good wagon-road, and by this
line of communication the products of the lands belonging
to the tracts of Aborbora and Braço de Gado could readily
be brought to the villa of Xiririca for shipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are lands belonging to the public domain in close
proximity to these private lands, of which I have a very
favorable report from Captain Buhlaw, formerly an officer
of the engineer department in the Confederate service, and
now employed by the Brazilian government to survey these
lands. In connection with a portion of this territory first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>examined, and lying nearest the river, I expect to effect a
provisional arrangement with the government of Brazil for
such an extent of public land as will accommodate those
families who look to me for a selection.</p>

<p class='c007'>These private lands lie almost parallel with the course of
the river, at a distance of from four to six miles from it,
and their products may all reach this navigable stream
either at Xiririca or Caiacauga; while those located higher
up, and extending to the Ribeira de Ignape, have a direct
shipment by canoes. The latter may deposit their cargoes
at Xiririca for the steamboat, or make the trips entire to
Ignape, as is done at present by many of the planters.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are other private lands which may be secured, of
similar quality to those described, and so situated as to
communicate readily with the Rio Jacupiranga, which is
navigable with the largest size of canoes into the lower part
of the Ribeira de Ignape.</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest portion of these lands being owned by Senor
Miguel Antonio Jorge, he proposes, if it is desirable, to
arrange with other parties for the transfer of these lands, so
as to bring all into one compact body, which would enable
our people to divide this territory more advantageously
among themselves, and to exclude those who might not be
desirable neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'>A paper has been received from this gentleman, in which
the price of his land is fixed at eighty-eight cents per acre,
the houses with straw covering going with the land, while
those with tile roofs are to be valued separately. It is
specified that the payments be made in three equal instalments,
at the end of the third, fourth and fifth years from
the date of the purchase, and the whole without interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should any one desire to anticipate the time fixed for
payment, a discount of six per cent. per annum for such
years as the amount was to remain unpaid will be allowed
upon receiving the payment. It is also stated that his
large fazenda, containing about one square league of land,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>located immediately upon the banks of the Ribeira de Ignape,
will be sold if it is desired. This place is known as
Ponto-Grosso, and is only forty miles above the town of
Ignape, with every facility of machinery and buildings that
would be requisite for a large business. A notice of it will
be seen under the record of the 10th inst. The price fixed
for this place is ten thousand (10,000) dollars, with the
same time and conditions as specified for the other lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, likewise, another place immediately upon the
river some fifteen miles above this fazenda, where cattle
are at present reared, and, though not in cultivation, presents
an elevated regular outline with indications of fertility.
This tract of land has a front on the water of perhaps three-fourths
of a mile, and a depth of two miles, yet the exact
measurements of this, as most of the land in this region of
country, have not been as yet ascertained. If Ponto-Grosso
should be sold this would likewise be disposed of, but not
otherwise, as it is a stopping place in passing from Caiacauga
to the above-named fazenda.</p>

<p class='c007'>As there are no cotton-gins introduced along this river,
and a considerable amount of cotton now planted, Ponto-Grosso
would be a favorable location for an extensive ginning
establishment, or even for a cotton factory.</p>

<p class='c007'>My friends of Caiacauga having treated me throughout
my sojourn here with the greatest possible kindness, Senor
Miguel and his very accomplished wife, Donna Maria,
walked with me to the canoe-landing this morning, to give
me their best wishes upon leaving their house. The noble
hospitality of these people exceeds any thing I ever expected
to realize among strangers, and, apart from any interested
motive, I believe it affords them a satisfaction to contribute
to the enjoyment of a guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>It being arranged that my young friend, Senor Guilherme,
would accompany me, we embarked at 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>two sturdy negro fellows to paddle us down the river; and
making a pleasant voyage, we reached Ponto-Grosso at 6½
o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>An ample stock of provisions had been supplied by my
hostess for the entire trip to Ignape, consisting of chickens,
fried fish, boiled rice, excellent bread, farina, bananas, figs,
and pine-apples. In addition to these, we were supplied
with a kind of beefsteak, enveloped in eggs and fried, so as
to afford a most palatable dish. Having partaken freely of
our stores on the way, a cup of coffee was all that I cared
to take upon arrival, though Senor Guilherme insisted upon
having a warm supper prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Previous to visiting this region of country, nothing could
be learned definitely in regard to its adaptation to the
growth of the staple commodities, corn, cotton, and coffee;
but my observations lead to the conclusion that each of them
may be produced here advantageously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corn has been heretofore one of the principal articles of
export to Santos and Rio de Janeiro; and, in the form of
big hominy, is used to a considerable extent in the country.
But corn bread is not known here, though the farina is
frequently made when that of the mandioca is not at hand.
The white flint corn is the only kind which is planted, and
though the ears are not large, it seems to be a sound, good
grain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The common white corn is said to be much more liable to
injury from weevils than this hard variety; and the yellow
or red corn is not found so marketable in the form of big
hominy, which is dried and shipped in large quantities. A
change of seed and improved culture would doubtless secure
better results in the growth of corn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cotton has been grown in this region by a few persons
for several years, with results that are conclusive as to the
favorable yield, and yet systematic culture is requisite to
test fully the quality and quantity that may be produced
in these river lands. Should the improved appliances and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the skilled labor of the Southern States be applied to the
culture of cotton here, I am satisfied the yield will exceed
that of the lands in the United States; and it is likely that
the amount of cotton grown in Brazil within a few years
will affect very much the markets of the world. The labor
of production is materially lessened by its continuous
growth from the same stalk, which is annually cut off and
yields again full crops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coffee has been seen here in lands of various kinds, and
of all ages, presenting the most favorable indications of an
abundant yield. The coffee produced in former years presents
also the characteristics of a good, sound grain; and I
am informed that the average yield of trees equals what
was stated elsewhere to be a full crop on the best lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several patches of coffee trees have been seen that did
not afford a prospect of good results; and it is evident that
a selection of location is a matter of moment here, as it is
found to be even in the districts where coffee is most successfully
cultivated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same kind of discrimination is necessary in determining
what localities are suited to the growth of other
articles, and a neglect of such precautions leads to a failure
in the crop of either.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rice is recognized as a certain and prolific product of all
this region, but more especially of the lower section where
lands become flat and moist. Mandioca yields abundantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beans, which are more prized in Brazil than any other
provision crop, are found to yield well in the lands visited,
and though some specimens of failure have been observed,
this has, for the most part, been satisfactorily accounted
for by planting out of season or other departure from good
farming. An abundant crop of sugar-cane, oranges, bananas,
figs, and grapes, with a most excellent quality of
pine-apples, makes up a variety of products which renders
this a desirable land for the settlement of those who seek a
home in Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rising before day my young friend had all our baggage
deposited in the canoe, and fresh eggs, with hot coffee and
bread were in readiness when I was summoned from my
bed. Partaking of these “fresh eggs,” etc., we resumed our
voyage down the river, and I found this was not to be regarded
as breakfast, but with the addition of two entire
chickens to our supplies for the trip, we breakfasted at
9 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, and dined at 4 o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> on the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had as fellow-passenger a young porcupine, (ouriço,)
that one of the negroes was taking down to sell as a pet;
and finding that he was testing the quality of our figs, the
negro guardian was called upon to secure the ugly little
varmint at one end of the canoe.</p>

<p class='c007'>We passed during the forenoon the mouths of the Rio
Jacupiranga and the Rio Paricoera, on the latter of which
I was told there are quite a number of inhabitants. Shortly
after mid-day we passed through a canal, or cut through a
neck of land, about one mile in length, which saved us four
miles in the natural course of the river. The difference of
level in the Ribeira is so slight at the entrance and outlet
of this artificial communication, that the current through it
is feeble, and instead of washing out it is gradually filling
up from the repeated rises of the river, and our canoe had
great difficulty in passing. The negroes labored hard, and
one of them got out several times to push the canoe through
the mud; but they worked with a good will, under the
promise of a drink of rum at the close. Both had previously
taken off their shirts, and with the confined air
of this narrow channel, the mosquitoes, and the hard
pulling, their bodies and arms were covered with perspiration
before reaching the open water of the river. After
getting their drink, and resting a short time, they proceeded
as usual again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another canal was encountered at no great distance, cutting
off another bend of the river, but it was much shorter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>and there was no difficulty in the passage. On approaching
the city of Ignape there is a very large artificial channel,
in which a small steamboat passes; and being very
straight, with the water running in the direction we came,
it made a very pleasant trip of over a mile, to the immediate
precincts of the city bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped with the brother of my young friend, Senor
Dom Miguel Jorge Montinegro, who is keeping house in
bachelor style, and places his establishment at my disposal
in a way that relieves me of all embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In descending the Ribeira it was observed that the corn
did not present so good an appearance as it had done
above, and in most places the banks were very low, so that
the general surface of the land must be submerged in the
floods of the river. When approaching the city the water
spreads out into various channels, over an extensive area,
again bringing up the resemblance to the Mississippi river
near its mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tainha, a fine fish which frequents these waters at
this season, was seen leaping up into the air to a distance
of three feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having met the Rev. Ballard Smith Dunn, of Louisiana,
at the hotel last evening, we found many topics of interest
in rehearsing what had been seen by each of us in this
country, and have spent this day together. He is acting in
behalf of a number of families who desire to be informed in
regard to Brazil, and has visited a portion of the provinces
of Rio de Janeiro and Esperitos de Santos. He was favorably
impressed with the inhabitants, and found some fine
lands, yet did not conclude that it was desirable to locate
in that region. He is now investigating the lands upon the
tributaries of the Ribeira, and considers the soil adjacent
to the waters of the Rio Jacupiranga of excellent quality,
with a very promising prospect for crops of corn in most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>parts. In passing through, from the colony of Cananea, he
reports that very fertile lands were seen, and he hopes to
find in this region a desirable location for his friends. He
will ascend the Rio Paricoera, and also the Rio Inquia;
which latter affords an encouraging field for examination, as
it is likely to be the line of communication with the great
iron-works of Epanema. If he should recommend some
portion of this territory for a settlement of people from the
Southern States, it would strengthen very much my conviction
of the advantages likely to accrue from a location in
the vicinity of Xiririca, as it is extremely desirable that
our people should be as far as practicable associated together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being detained to-day in Ignape, awaiting the arrival of
the steamer, to proceed to Cananea, I may note some points
connected with this port of entry. It is located upon a low
flat point of land, with a rugged mountain ridge rising up
at a short distance from it, and the whole is surrounded by
water. With a low land extending up from the city, along
the Ribeira for a considerable distance, it is not a matter
of surprise that the place is reported to be unhealthy, and
recently there has been a very serious epidemic, bloody flux,
prevailing, attended with considerable fatality, but has now
ceased.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a very large church in the process of completion,
at a central point of the buildings in the place; and
the abandoned walls of an immense jail that was supposed
to be in demand some years ago, but the improved morals
of the population, or the want of resources, induced them
to leave it unfinished. There are but few houses of two
stories, conforming to the type of most of the interior towns
in having one-story buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general appearance of the population does not give
a favorable impression of their physical stamina, or their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>intellectual status, yet I have met several gentlemen of refinement
and cleverness, among whom I may especially mention
Dom Antonio Joaquim Rodrigues, Juiz de Direita, and
my young friend Dom Miguel Jorge Montinegro, who holds
the position corresponding to our District Attorney, or Solicitor
for the State. The latter speaks some English, and
we got on very pleasantly, in his snug bachelor’s retreat,
during my stay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving Ignape during the forenoon, in the Dom Affonso,
we steamed along the inland sea, known as Mare Pequeno,
and really the Bay of Venice cannot present a scene of more
simple beauty than this placid sheet of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several cozy-looking dwellings are located very near the
margin, and the borders are fringed with green foliage, while
here and there an islet is slightly elevated above the surface,
and to complete the picture, water-fowls of various
plumage are seen either resting upon the water or flying
around with evident surprise at the presence of our little
intruder.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the afternoon a heavy rain drove us from
the deck into the cabin, and as the shades of evening were
closing around us, the steamer reached the villa of Cananea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after anchoring, Senor E. H. Street came aboard,
and took me ashore to spend the night. We called upon
Captain Buhlaw and lady, and also Mr. Hanson and lady,
living in the same house. They are favorably impressed
with the suitableness of the country for their future residence;
and arrangements are already completed by those two
gentlemen, for the location of a saw-mill upon the river
Guarahu, five miles above its confluence with the Rio Jacupiranga,
which proceeds thence thirty miles into the Ribeira
de Ignape.</p>

<p class='c007'>We took tea with these Southern people, and while sitting
in that little social group, unfettered by any political domination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>my thoughts turned anxiously to the fate of those
who remained in the South.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>January 25, 1866</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We breakfasted with our Southern friends, and relished it
the more for being prepared by the hands of the ladies.
Mrs. Hanson is quite a young woman with one child, and
seems prepared to take life as she may find it, saying that
she only wants now to get a place fixed where she could
have her own garden, and raise her own poultry, to feel entirely
independent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Buhlaw does not seem to adapt herself so readily to
this border style of living, yet she is cheerful, and hopeful
of the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>These families are sojourning only temporarily here, until
arrangements for their accommodation are completed at some
distance in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villa of Cananea is one of the oldest settlements in
Brazil, the fleet of Martin Affonso de Sonza having landed
at this place, August 12, 1531, and placed upon the island
of Abrigo, at an elevated point known as Morro São Joas,
two stone pillars, which are still to be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>This island upon which the villa is located is at the outlet
of the long, narrow body of water, which we traversed in
coming from Ignape. Though the mouth of the Ribeira
leads out to the ocean, opposite to the city of Ignape the
bar is so shallow as to preclude the passage of vessels in
that direction, so that they are required to come through
this Mare Pequeno, a distance of forty-five miles, for an outlet;
and, if going towards Rio de Janeiro, must return along
the coast the same distance, to reach the point from which
they might proceed directly if the mouth of the river could
be made navigable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of this circuitous navigation, it is very desirable
that a good wagon-road should be constructed from Xiririca
across the country to the port of Cananea near the main
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>land. I am informed by Senor Street and Captain Buhlaw
that the route is very favorable even for a railroad; while
the port is capable of admitting, with good protection, vessels
of the largest size. The largest extent of public lands
lies south of this proposed road, and products might be
conveyed along it either to Xiririca or to the port of Cananea,
as might be most convenient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemic bloody flux, which visited the city of Ignape,
is now prevailing in Cananea, and has been attended with
great fatality, more especially among children. In one
family as many as eight persons have died in one month,
and a number of deaths have occurred in other families.
But the population have now to a large extent left the
villa and gone into the country, where they are entirely
exempt from the disease. The absence of a means of proper
treatment has doubtless added very much to the fatal results,
as there was no medical man residing in either of
these places, and though a doctor is paid now by the province,
and medicines furnished to him for the treatment of
the sick at Cananea, there is but little confidence reposed
in his skill or his integrity and faithfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding this epidemic as a transient disease, confined
to these populated localities, it does not augur any thing
unfavorable to the healthfulness of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having resumed my voyage upon the Dom Affonso,
Senor Street and myself were reduced to the necessity of
sleeping upon the table in the small cabin, with all the
apertures closed on account of a fall of rain. In addition
to the crowded condition of the berths by whites, and others
slightly tinged, there were several negro women of the real
ebony stamp sleeping upon the floor, and with the confined
air, charged with emanations from various accumulations
during the night, our situation was little short of the Black
Hole of Calcutta. I will say, however, for the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>management aboard of the small and antiquated steamboat,
that it was very satisfactory; and though the table does
not compare with that of the Santa Maria, every thing is
well prepared and clean. The large number of persons aboard
indicates that a better boat with larger accommodations is
needed upon this line, which makes a trip monthly, touching
at the points upon the coast as far south as Santa Catharina.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon entering Santos we found the English steamer
Galileo loading for Rio de Janeiro; and as the passage is
likely to be more expeditious as well as more comfortable,
Senor Street and myself with two or three other passengers
have arranged to go in this vessel to-morrow morning.
She is consigned to Mr. W. T. Wright.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since my former visit, Mr. and Mrs. Wright have been
favored with a daughter, which is now a month old; and
she is again doing the duties of her household with her
customary grace and kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am indebted to my friend, Mr. Wright, for collecting
the following valuable data pertaining to this city and
province, as well as the whole empire of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>The only practical distinction here is, into cooler and
warmer season, but the classification is made and the
months will be thus arranged into seasons:</p>

<p class='c007'>Summer.—December, January, and February.</p>

<p class='c007'>Autumn.—March, April, and May.</p>

<p class='c007'>Winter.—June, July, and August.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spring.—September, October, and November.</p>

<p class='c007'>The highest temperature is about 90°, and the lowest is
about 60° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The summer months constitute the rainy season, and the
winter months the driest part of the year in most of the
territory of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government of Brazil consists of the Emperor and
his Council, the Senate, and House of Deputies, acting
under the constitution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cabinet is formed as that of Great Britain; one man
being commissioned by the Emperor, selects his portfolio
and colleagues, he becoming president or premier of the
council. The members are ministers of the empire, of
foreign affairs, of finance, of war, of the navy, of justice;
and under one head, of commerce, agriculture, with public
works; making seven departments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senators are balloted for by electors, the three highest
being forwarded to the Emperor, who selects one to fill the
office, which is held for life. It is not requisite that he
shall be a resident of the province for which he is chosen.
Deputies are chosen every four years by electors. The
Emperor can dissolve any congress and call for a new election
as in Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a judge for each district, and two terms of
court each year. In trial by jury, the decision is by plurality,
and grade of punishment according to majority.</p>

<p class='c007'>Courts of appeal at Bahia, Maranhão, and other places,
while there is a supreme court for higher offences. There
is no grand jury, but process formed by delegado or sub-delegado
of police, (corresponding to sheriff and deputy,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>and if there is reason found for trial, indictment is sent to
the municipal judge, (corresponding to magistrate,) and if
approved he sends it to the district judge; and when approved
by him, the case is ordered for trial before the jury.
Magistrates elected by the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to delegado and sub-delegado appointed by
the President of the province for each district, there is a
chief of police for each province appointed by the Emperor.
Each province has its own legislature, chosen by
the people. The President has veto power, which may be
set aside by a two-thirds vote.</p>

<p class='c007'>One archbishop residing at Bahia is the chief see, and
there is also a bishop for each province, and a vicar in each
district.</p>

<p class='c007'>One mint at Rio de Janeiro, and the Bank of Brazil, with
sundry others, is also located there; while there are branch
banks in various provinces for issue, and private banks for
deposit and discount.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schools and colleges are numerous. A law academy in
São Paulo, and also in Bahia. A medical college in Rio
de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor Street and myself came aboard of the fine steamship
Galileo at 10 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, but the vessel was detained
a considerable time by a hawser becoming entangled in her
screw.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man was brought from the city by her agent, Mr. W.
T. Wright, who dived down under the wheel, and remaining
over a minute under the water, succeeded in disentangling
the cable.</p>

<p class='c007'>This vessel is the second English steamer that has recently
taken loading from this port, under an arrangement
effected by Mr. Wright for the permission of coastwise
freight by foreign bottoms, in consideration of the large
proportion of Brazilian vessels now chartered by the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>in connection with the belligerent operations
against Paraguay. The troops of Lopez have now been
withdrawn from Brazilian territory, and yet hold a defiant
attitude upon the soil of Paraguay. It is now the purpose
of the Emperor to conquer a peace with these troublesome
neighbors, and it is generally thought that hostilities will
soon be successfully ended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Galileo has taken aboard here nineteen hundred and
fifty-two (1952) bales of cotton of the small size, weighing
one hundred and twelve (112) pounds, some of which stop
at Rio de Janeiro, while another portion is for shipment to
Liverpool. She brought from Montevideo a partial cargo,
consisting of two hundred sheep, and all the appurtenances
of the slaughtering of cattle, hides, horns, and bones,
amounting to some five hundred tons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sheep and a portion of the cargo are shipped for
Rio, while the remainder goes to England.</p>

<p class='c007'>This vessel has excellent passenger accommodations, and
the table is served differently from that of the Brazilian
steamers, the waiters supplying promptly all the wants of
the guests in the former, while in the latter passengers are
expected to look after their own wants during the meals.
In the fare of Brazilian steamers, table wine is included,
while on the English vessel all wines, beer, or liquors are a
separate item of charge, and there is a margin of two (2.00)
dollars difference in the rates between the Santa Maria and
the Galileo, the passage on the former being eighteen (18.00)
dollars, while that of the latter is sixteen (16.00) dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find on board Captain Markam, the master of the
unfortunate Herschel, that was wrecked below a short time
since. His vessel first struck upon a rock not indicated in
the charts, and was so badly damaged that all preparatory
steps were taken for the safety of the passengers and crew
in the boats. But he still had a hope of getting her into
the port of Marlausdo, and placing her under the direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>of a pilot she was run upon a rock a second time and was
lost, all on board being saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>An English gentleman named Stickney, who was aboard
of the Herschel, is now a passenger with us, and has been
examining some of the territory of Brazil, with reference to
farming and sheep-raising. He is much pleased with some
of the country, but has not yet made any selection. I infer
from his own statements, that he has been conducting quite
an extensive business in this department in England, and
it would be very desirable to see some of those experienced
farmers entering into that neat and systematic style of business
in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The harbor of Rio de Janeiro was entered to-day at 1
o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> Being hailed at the fort and boarded by three
different officials of the Brazilian government, our vessel
proceeded to her anchorage, and I reached the wharf at 3
o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> My quarters are taken again at the Exchange
Hotel, and having a small bed-room, with an open hall in
front that is well ventilated, I am likely to have a quiet time
for preparing my report to the Minister of Agriculture pertaining
to my tour of observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Making a hurried inquiry at the office and other places
for letters, none were found, and I proceeded in a boat to a
bark that had recently arrived from New York, thinking it
might bring some tidings of my family or friends. I was
not permitted by the custom-house officers to go aboard, as
the vessel had not yet been passed with her cargo; but upon
speaking with the Captain from the row-boat, he informed
me that any letters brought had gone to the post-office,
under the existing regulations, two days ago. I knew,
therefore, that nothing had come for me.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire forenoon was occupied with my report for the
minister, and it was only suspended when the announcement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>was made that the United States packet Havana had
arrived in the harbor. Being informed that no one was
permitted to go aboard while she was still in charge of the
custom-house officers, I awaited the arrival of passengers
and learned that there were no people aboard from the
Southern States, so that there was no prospect of hearing
through anyone from my friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. G. N. Davis kindly accompanied me to the post-office,
and personally examined the letters received by the
packet, but nothing was found for me. This inscrutable
interruption of all communication with my friends in the
South leaves no other alternative than to return and confer
with them in person respecting my impressions of the
territory, climate, productions and government of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senor E. D. Street has arranged for a meeting with the
Minister of Agriculture at 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abstract of my observations upon the soil and industrial
resources of the country, examined during the past
four months, was embodied in a report of thirty-two pages of
large letter paper, and presented to his Excellency, Conselheiro
Paulo Sonsa, Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, &#38;c.,
to-day. My interview was very brief, as he had an appointment
elsewhere, which prevented him from giving audience
to numerous persons in attendance, and he appointed day
after to-morrow for another meeting. In the mean time he
can examine my paper and be prepared to make a response
to the propositions therein submitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>On my return I called at the office of Dom Galvão, where
he was found with his secretary, Mr. Mello. These gentlemen
renewed their offers of assistance in any way they
could serve my objects. But no satisfactory information
has been received in regard to the terms upon which negroes
may be hired from the province of Minas, and I will direct
my efforts to procuring another class of laborers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>I am informed by Mr. William Scully, the editor of the
<cite>Anglo-Brazilian Times</cite>, that he has had frequent applications
from parties in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in
regard to securing employment for laborers from those
countries; and that so soon as we can give him any assurance
of the number that will be required for business operations
among our people who propose to settle in Brazil, he
can certainly secure them for the service.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being constantly occupied during the entire morning, I
did not have an opportunity to get my breakfast, and, when
it was nearly one o’clock, I went into the Café Americano
for a lunch that could be most promptly served. Cold ham,
shrimps and salad, with bread and butter, stayed my stomach;
and yet it proved to be a very costly repast, as a fine
silk umbrella was left in the establishment which could not
be found upon returning to look for it some two hours afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>In compliance with previous invitation, I dined to-day
with Mr. Malone and his family, who are keeping house in
the precinct of São Domingos. Mr. J. A. Roussel, from
Louisiana, went over with me on the ferry-boat, and I met
at the house Dr. D. Dansereau, also from Louisiana, and
Mr. P. B. Hockaday, an old gentleman from Missouri, all of
whom are here to select locations for their future residence.
The latter two are accommodated with boarding by Mr. and
Mrs. Malone, and seem to be pleasantly situated. This lady
looks rather delicate, and yet she is doing the cooking and
housework for the family with her own hands, and says that
she is too busy to think of troubles or cares, feeling quite
cheerful and contented with her situation. They have two
very interesting little daughters, one about nine years old,
and the other about seven. Their health has improved
since coming here, and they are now quite hearty and
sprightly. This family reached Brazil some six months
ago, and found many trials at the outset from the want of
associations with any of their own people, and the failure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>to find any field of business in which they could be employed
to advantage. But now they are in good spirits,
and expect ere long to identify themselves with others who
are expected to arrive from the Southern States, and form a
settlement in some part of the country. In their present
sphere of duty, they render essential service to those stopping
in Rio.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I sat down with Southern friends, at the table of a
Southern family, and partook of the food prepared by the
hands of a Southern lady in a foreign land, the change which
has come over our people was fully realized; yet this presented
a type of the independence to which every Southern
heart aspired, and which can only be enjoyed now by a
separation from those who hold us in subjection.</p>

<p class='c007'>On returning upon the ferry-boat, I was introduced to
Mr. Franklin and Colonel Parsons, of Texas, who are here
for the purpose of locating in the country. The latter gentleman
is just recovering from a slight attack of varioloid,
contracted from some Brazilian soldiers on board of the
vessel coming from Bahia to Rio. The former has also
been indisposed for a few days. But both are again ready
for business, and they are now making arrangements to
open a mercantile house in this city for furnishing machinery
and agricultural implements. They expect to be provided
with every thing that is likely to be wanted in opening
plantations; yet it will be desirable for planters to bring
with them all they may need.</p>

<p class='c007'>The family of Mr. Gunter, from Alabama, with that of
his son-in-law, are located in Botafogo, and await his return
from an exploration of the country to determine upon
a location. They have been very kindly assisted and looked
after by that noble-souled friend of Southerners, Mr. Carlos
Nathan. His acts of kindness will relieve the embarrassments
of many who have received favors at his hands,
and among that number I shall always feel thankful for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>gentlemanly courtesy and substantial aid which he has extended
to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a view to promote in a more enlarged sphere the
emigration of our people, a proposition has been submitted
to the Brazilian government by Mr. Nathan, in which arrangements
will be made by him for the transportation of
persons from the Southern States to Brazil, with the privilege
to the emigrants of paying the passage-money in three
instalments, at the end of the third, fourth, and fifth years,
and without interest. He assumes the responsibility of
guaranteeing to the government the payment of these passage
bills which it is to receive, giving him bonds for the
amount, with the allowance of a certain amount for each
emigrant that is thus brought from the United States to
Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>No action has been taken as yet upon this practical business
proposition, which would systematize the transportation
across the ocean, and enable many to accomplish the removal
to Brazil who otherwise will not be able to avail themselves
of transportation.</p>

<p class='c007'>A highly important meeting of citizens was held to-day
at the hall of the Merchants’ Exchange, at which the Minister
of Agriculture and other important officials co-operated
with many of the most influential men of the city, for
the consideration of measures most likely to promote emigration
to Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two meetings have been held prior to this, and propositions
were submitted by Senor Dom Furquim d’Almeida,
which have in view the recognition of all the civil and religious
privileges which can be desired by our people in coming
into this empire. This gentleman has great worth of
character, and exercises much control in the affairs of the
country, so that his prominent advocacy of these reforms
has secured the concurrence of a large number of important
persons, and through this influence it is expected that action
of the government will be secured.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>An organization has been formed to-day with the object
of facilitating all the different steps towards settlement in
this country; and with a view to reach more adequately
those for whose benefit it is designed, foreigners are to
be associated with Brazilians in a committee for carrying
out the plans of this society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few matters are initiated here by a public assemblage of
the people, such as that now witnessed in regard to emigration,
and it indicates a widespread and abiding conviction
of the importance that is attached to the settlement of the
Southern planters in the territory of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The official authorities have manifested great readiness
to receive favorably all of our people who have sought any
position in connection with the government; and they have
afforded all the facilities practicable for aiding those who
desired to examine the resources of the country, while they
hold out the encouragement of prospective assistance to
such as may need aid in emigrating to this empire with
their families.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people everywhere exhibit likewise the most cordial
disposition to favor this movement.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A brief summary of the report submitted to the Minister
of Agriculture will give a general view of the field of observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the purposes of description, the following division of
soil is recognized: Volcanic earth, (terra rocha,) red land,
(terra vermilha,) dark land, (terra preta,) and light land,
(terra branca.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A further distinction results from the predominance of
clay, sand, shell, and decomposed vegetable matter. These
are combined in various proportions with other elements,
in different specimens of soil examined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The territory is divided into original forest, (matto virgem,)
secondary forest, (capoeira,) and open plain, (campo.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>The soil of the forest is superior to that of the plain, and
yet has many grades.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fruits and medicinal plants found to a large extent in
some of the open plains.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of the native trees of the United States are found
growing in the forests examined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The province of São Paulo may be divided into four different
sections, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1st. Coast land, including the land lying between the sea
and the neighboring serra adjacent to Santos, Conceicão,
Ignape and Cananea.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this the soil has rotten-shell combined with sand to a
large extent. Rice is the chief product of this region.</p>

<p class='c007'>2d. Table land, including the territory lying south of the
Serra Nigro, and lying adjacent to Campinas, Lemeira, Rio
Clara, Araraquara, Brotas, Jahu, and Botacatu.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best purple soil (terra rocha) is here in close proximity
to the poorest light sandy plains, and, while the latter
are unproductive, the former are considered the most favorable
for coffee and all the standard staples of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>3d. Mixed land, including the territory lying between the
former and the Serra da Cubitão, and lying adjacent to
Jundiahi, São Paulo, Itu, Porto Feliz, Sorocaba, Itapetininga,
and Paranapanema.</p>

<p class='c007'>Extensive grass plains are intermixed with forests of light
land, and occasionally dark soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former very suitable for grazing stock, and the latter
are giving very favorable results in the culture of cotton and
corn.</p>

<p class='c007'>4th. River land, including the territory lying upon the
upper waters of the Ribeira de Ignape, and its tributaries
from each side, and being adjacent to Inquia, Iporanga and
Xiririca.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forest land prevails here exclusively, having for the most
part a dark soil with a yellow clay base. Corn, rice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>sugar-cane have been the principal products, yet this region
is well adapted to the growth of tobacco, cotton and coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all of these sections, the different tropical fruits,
oranges, bananas, pine-apples, &#38;c., grow to great advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hoe is alone used in the culture of the land, and only
three plows were seen in the entire province. The introduction
of the plow is likely to improve the agricultural
operations, and may serve to eradicate that great pest of
the planter, the ant. It is especially needed in the preparation
of the soil for cotton, and the increasing importance of
that crop is apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pack-mules are the reliance for transportation of product
to market, from section second and third, for the present.
But a railroad line is expected to be in operation soon,
which will be available for a portion of each of these sections.
It runs from Santos to Jundiahi, eighty-five miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Communication with a market, by water, is convenient
for sections first and fourth. The former affords no inducement
for any large settlement, while the latter presents a
wide extent of territory, lying between the Ribeira de
Ignape and Cananea, and extending towards Parana. If it
should meet the views of our people to concentrate upon
this territory, a large wagon-road is desirable to connect
Xiririca and the port of Cananea, so as to afford them access
to either of these ports.</p>

<p class='c007'>The route indicated is pronounced by an engineer to be
very favorable for the location of a good road, and if it is
authorized, it will constitute an important item in the advantages
of this section, for the settlement of emigrants
from the southern portion of the United States of America.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Thursday</span>, <i>February 1, 1866</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In an interview with his Excellency Conselheiro Paulo
Sonsa, Minister of Agriculture, &#38;c., I have received his assurance
that a wagon-road should be opened from the port
of Cananea to Xiririca; and that the requisite order would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>be issued forthwith for setting apart the funds for this work.
He has likewise given me a promise that an amount of
public land, sufficient for the accommodation of my friends,
would be reserved in a specified locality, until I should communicate
to him some definite intimation as to their decision.
I am farther informed that authority will be given
me to hire a vessel at the expense of the Brazilian government,
for the use of the needy, provided two other vessels
are loaded by emigrants on their own account; and that
the vessels would be permitted to land their passengers and
cargoes free of duty, at Cananea or Ignape, if this is desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this understanding, I feel that my mission in Brazil
has terminated satisfactorily, and I am now ready to submit
the result for the consideration of those who await this
report.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physical aspects of Brazil present great encouragement
to those desiring to engage in agricultural operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great variety and superior quality of the products
present advantages not to be realized in the United States,
and the facility of cultivation, with the prospect of improvement
under the more thorough treatment of the soil to which
our people are accustomed, renders this branch of business
particularly attractive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manufacturing resources afforded by the water-power
which is in almost every section of the country,
afford the opportunity for working up much of the material
grown upon the soil, and enterprise may speedily put to
work spindles and looms even at points remote from the
great lines of transportation. To our Southern people the
empire of Brazil embodies the character and sentiment
among the better class of citizens, very much in keeping
with our standard of taste and politeness. It has grown
out of the consciousness that worth makes the man, and
doubtless connected with the same relative status of races
that was formerly a line of distinction between the black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>and white population with us. Though slavery may be
destined to cease in Brazil at some future day, by gradual
emancipation, yet the elements of society which have resulted
from the mastery of the white man will never be
erased entirely from the people. There is a dignity and a
hospitality among these people that correspond in many
respects to the lofty and generous bearing which characterized
the Southern gentleman in former times. We find
people in Brazil capable of appreciating the Southern character,
and ready to extend a cordial greeting to all who
come.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The adoption of a British flag by this ship-owner during the
progress of the war enabled him to continue sailing upon the high
seas, and his sentiments being known to the confederate cruisers,
secured one of his vessels from destruction, that fell into their hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>As vessels of Great Britain and the United States are more largely
occupied in navigating the high seas than those of other nationalities,
it is the custom of those meeting upon the ocean to hail in English,
and there is scarcely a captain in charge of a vessel of any nation
that is not sufficiently acquainted with the English language to
communicate in this way with another.</p>

<p class='c007'>The code of signals used by the English have been adopted by
all nations navigating the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific; and
thus vessels communicate with each other upon any matter desired,
without being in speaking distance.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. This discount upon United States money is practised very often
upon strangers by those occupying other positions than hucksters,
but a dollar in gold or silver coin of the United States will command
two millreas of Brazilian money in most respectable business establishments
of Rio de Janeiro, and is generally valued at this rate by
exchange brokers. Upon this standard one dump is worth two cents,
and I should have received twelve dumps and a half for my quarter
instead of the ten which were given. It will save the reader who
may go to Rio more than the price of this book, to keep in mind
what is stated in this note.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Captain Lee informs me that in August, 1864, there sailed from
Bahia a vessel containing over one hundred of these liberated negroes
in families, men, and women, and children, who were bound for
Africa, with the expectation of remaining in that country. They
expressed a hope of being able to exert a favorable influence upon
the natives, and it would be a very interesting part of their history
to know whether they have lapsed into barbarism or have improved
those with whom their lot is cast in Africa.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. This gentleman has since ceased to be the chief engineer of the
railroad, and his brother now occupies the position.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. This admirable disinfecting establishment was subsequently
visited. The materials are pumped from the reservoir, which is
below the level of the water, and subjected to the action of various
articles, among which I recognized alum, lime and charcoal, after
which a deposit of the solid portions is formed in receptacles of immense
proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fluid being acted upon by these agents, and then filtered, is
rendered so entirely free from impurities that we were informed the
superintendent drank some of it on the occasion of a visit by the
Emperor, to illustrate the perfection of the process of disinfection.
Delicious draught, no doubt!</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no unpleasant smell about the place, and the remaining
solid matter is employed as a fertilizer, without any of the disagreeable
concomitants of poudrette.</p>

<p class='c007'>The building is an elegant stone structure, and the operations are
conducted by steam, under the immediate control of the English
contractors, who are known as the city improvement company.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentleman in charge stated that this was an entirely new
process, and that it has not been introduced elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. A sack of coffee weighing one hundred and sixty pounds is carried
in this way without any apparent inconvenience, and most of
the loading of vessels from the warehouses near the wharf is performed
after this manner. The negroes usually move under such a
burden in a brisk walk, or more frequently in a trot; and a number
being employed, the work progresses very rapidly in putting a cargo
of coffee aboard a ship.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. I am indebted to Captain E. A. Lie, the intelligent master of
the vessel in which my return passage was made, for some interesting
particulars in regard to Pompeii, which he visited in 1857. His
statement is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mass of volcanic matter which overlies the site of the former
city of Pompeii is principally ashes, and on the borders has
undergone such changes, that fields are in cultivation upon the spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The explorations are entirely under the directions of the Imperial
Government, and a guard is kept constantly over the place,
so as to prevent any one from appropriating articles that may be
discovered by those engaged in the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The streets are so contracted that even the narrow vehicles of
that period were unable to pass each other, and hence some of the
thoroughfares are supposed to have afforded passage in one direction,
while others were passed in the opposite direction. The deep
cuts in the stone paving of the streets indicate that there was much
passing of carriages or carts for a long period.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Connecting with the side-walks there are stones elevated above
the general level of the streets, upon which persons might step and
avoid water that was flowing in the street. There are no signs of
drains or sewers to be seen, nor of aqueducts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those bodies remaining in the houses at the time of this wholesale
burial are completely petrified, and black as ebony, a number of
which are preserved in all their perfection of form. There are also
petrified specimens of fruits, of bread, even with the baker’s name
imprinted on it; of beef, of pork, and of various viands that were
ready for eating.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A large number of precious stones have been recovered, and
among them an immense convex emerald, of great value, which
was discovered in a tomb, supposed to contain the body of some
very important dignitary. Many rich treasures have been found in
the cemetery, evidently lodged with the dead in their last resting-place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are evidences of much taste in the architectural department,
and specimens of very elaborate workmanship have been discovered.
The amphitheatre was evidently a grand structure, and
with the base below the general surface of the earth, it is arranged
with ascending rows of stone seats for the accommodation of a large
assemblage. All the buildings are of stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is an extensive museum at Naples, which contains all the
varieties from this reservoir of antiquarian relics; and to make the
tour of this establishment, with a proper examination of these articles,
and others of interest collected there, requires two weeks of
unremitting observation.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Captain Buhlaw received an appointment similar in rank to that
held in the confederate service, and has been charged with the survey
and mapping of the public lands near Cananea.
In this service Mr. Mallory is associated with him under appointment
of the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the tender of an appointment to the writer, the length
of time occupied in the examination of the country precluded any
other duty.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. After the return of the Emperor from the seat of war, he and
the Empress were seen in their coach, with six horses and a number
of outriders. She endeavored to return the courtesies of those on
the street by an almost incessant series of motions of the head
from side to side, while he maintained an attitude of dignified
complacence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horses are managed by men seated upon the saddle-horse of
each pair, and they dash through the street at a rapid gait, a bugle
being sounded frequently by a man riding in advance, so as to have
the way cleared for the passage of the royal cortege.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. Though this ant is so troublesome in the culture of the cotton
grown from American seed, it does not attack the Brazilian cotton,
which seems to be a variety of the sea island plant, that has been
grown to a limited extent for a considerable period in Brazil. The
stalk of this latter becomes very large, and really assumes the proportions
of a small tree after growing three or four successive years.
The lint is fine and the seed black and clean, but the yield is much
less than the cotton from our ordinary short staple seed. The exemption
from injury by the ant would constitute a very important
recommendation if it produced as well as the other variety, but it is
entirely abandoned since the introduction of the seed from the United
States.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. At his suggestion, an article appeared in the <cite><span lang="pt">Diario De São
Paulo</span></cite>, of September 26th, 1865, from which the following extracts
are translated:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This commission of Dr. Gaston arouses serious considerations.
Under existing circumstances, our attention ought to be fixed, by
preference, upon the States of the South of the American Union.
A large portion of the party vanquished in the recent struggle will
seek a new country. They cannot submit to the new order of things
and live on a footing of equality with their slaves. Accumulated
trouble, and various other reasons, concur to induce them to emigrate.
If our government lose this favorable opportunity to draw
them to our country it will not find another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If these families come, many others will come after them, and
thus spontaneous emigration will be developed for our country. In
the disposition with which they are now proposing to emigrate, it is
natural that they should flow into the same place, and the country
which has the happiness to receive well the first emigrants will receive
all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The emigration from the States of the South of the Union is
exactly that which suits us best. We do not want adventurers, who
come into our country to gain fortunes, and that return to their
domicils when they are secured. We want men who will establish
themselves diligently in our country, and who will make common
cause with us. The American emigrants that come will remain
with us, and will never return to their country. The motives which
induce the emigration afford us, in this respect, a complete guarantee.
They procure a new country. They take as theirs the country
which receives them. This consideration is important.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Anglo-American race has no rival in the world. The
grand struggle through which they have passed leaves their prominence
well established. It is the race which is most appropriate
for us. Eminently industrious, enterprising and persevering, it will
impart a notable impulse to our country. It is not possible to calculate
the rapid progress which the country may have if this race
comes, to turn to advantage its natural resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our political institutions cannot be repugnant to those inhabitants
of the Union. In our country they will find all the liberty
which can reasonably be desired. Our form of government, though
it is not federative, approximates this system. The separate action
of the provinces gives them, to a certain extent, an independent
existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The spectacle of slavery, which so much impresses strangers,
will be viewed with indifference by those emigrants from the Southern
States of the Union, that until very recently held slaves, and
for this object sustained the greatest struggle which the world has
seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This subject deserves the special attention of the Government,
whose lights and practical knowledge should guide the emissary of
the emigrants in the selection of a locality that may be proper to
receive them, giving him every means of enlightenment and information.
The stranger, however qualified he may be, can easily
be deceived in this respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All depends upon the success of the first emigrants, and for the
accomplishment of this every care should be taken in this matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our countrymen should not expect to sell their lands to these
new emigrants for fabulous prices. If they bring some means they
cannot nevertheless employ large capitals, because they have not
got them. They once had fortunes, but the war has wasted them.
The devastation which passed over the States of the South is well
known.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. A notice has since appeared in the public prints of the falling
down of this building, and the killing of several workmen. It is
attributed to some excavation made in the vicinity of the wall, but
the construction was such as might favor its downfall, and the use
of the term ruin in the description implies such a condition.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. It is not usual to find pepper, vinegar, catsup, mustard, or any
thing of this kind upon the tables of the common people in the
country, and hence the presence of these articles becomes a fact
worthy of notice.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. This expression, and the same placing of the hands with the
palms together in front of the breast are observed also by children
in approaching a parent for the first time after rising in the morning,
or after being absent for a time. It is a common practice among
the better class of people, and even after the children are grown.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. The valuation placed by the owner upon this portion of the
land is ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, and taking the amount of
productive land as only three thousand (3,000) acres, having in all
one hundred thousand coffee trees, the calculation per acre of three
and a third ($3.33⅓) dollars is certainly very much more favorable
than most improved land can be bought elsewhere in this region of
country.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. The owner of the land proposes to take seven thousand five
hundred dollars ($7,500) for the lands lying adjacent to the river
Roque, which are supposed to include two thousand acres of good
land, but estimated as containing more than double that amount by
the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of land described as of superior quality, in a southwest
course from the buildings, with the site of the fazenda, are not
offered for sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few families might be accommodated with these lands, but they
are not adapted for a large settlement of people.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one point the Roque tract is said to connect with Angelica,
and if that territory can be bought upon similar terms, it would
permit extension of the population; but, as was stated, Senor
Vergueiro declined to name the price fixed upon that property.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. A very fine specimen of brown sandstone was found in large
quantity upon this land, and the fact is mentioned to illustrate the
resources of the country.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. I am constantly reminded of my obligations to this gentleman
in the use of a fine large blank-book, which was presented by him
for my records, besides many other acts of kindness on his part.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. Members of the same family very generally have different
names in Brazil; and when a family name is recognized, it is not
always placed last as with us, but is arranged with the other names
as fancy may suggest.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. I am informed that extensive hat-factories are in operation in
Perecicaba, Rio Claro, Campinas and in the province of Minas,
where they are made in several of the fazendas. They are prepared
of good quality from both fur and wool, but the price of the
latter should secure an excellent article.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. There is no tax on lands except a small per cent. paid at the
time of purchase, and that even is not required in the sale of government
land to our people.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. Captain Lie tells me this custom of shaking hands all round
after dinner is very common with the families of Norway when
there is company at their houses. It is not general in Brazil, but so
far as observed, is confined to this family, and I supposed that all
were taking leave to depart for their respective homes, but found
that they repaired to the parlor for further social intercourse.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. In the midst of all this poverty it is most remarkable that theft
is very rare in this country, and throughout every class of people
there seems to be no necessity for any special safeguards to property
of any description.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even in the towns and cities through which I have passed there
are fewer precautions observed against larceny than is customary
in all parts of the United States, and the general confidence manifested
in the honesty of the people is a very commendable feature
of society.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. This amount, in common with other expenses of travel, was
paid by the agent of the government, Senor G. D. Street, and while
noting the want of generosity on the part of this representative man
of Conceicão, I would not fail to acknowledge our obligations for the
bounty of the Brazilian government in providing for all our wants
while exploring the country.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. On arrival at this place we found a portion of the men seated
upon the dirt floor of a house playing cards for money, while the
more religiously-inclined population were assembled in the church
to pray for a cessation of the continuous rains which flooded the
lands. So go the different elements of society.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. As a matter of history, the following paragraph of a correspondent
from this place, of September 18, 1865, to the Diario de
São Paulo, is translated, though I hear of no other instance of the
kind in this or any other part of the province.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within little more than one month there has occurred in this
section seven assassinations of Christian people, namely: those of
Sonsa, his son and son-in-law, by the Indians of São Domingos,
that of Filisbino, according to report, by his native slave Silverio,
on the Rio Novo; those of Francisco Bernardo, and Leopoldina
Cordoso Martines, in the same region, and that of Salvador José
Leite, on the small river Das Pedras.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. Major Meriwether writes me as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Botocatu</span>, January 8, 1866.—I was not prepared to see lands
so immensely rich as we see here. We have examined the country
ten miles in one direction, and every foot of it is the very best
quality. Immense bodies of the best land are here.</p>

<p class='c007'>“January 13, 1866.—We have just returned this day from
Lençoes, taking five days to make the trip there and back, forty or
more miles, to avoid crossing a belt of country fifty miles wide, in
which the chills prevail unusually severe. In going to and returning
from Lençoes, not on the same road both ways, we were never
off good land, and the most of it first quality terra rocha. Corn
was certainly the best I ever saw, and not a plough in all the country.
Coffee trees, none of which are over four years old, loaded
down with fruit. Cotton, little planted, but that little very fine.
Grasses in abundance; and stock, mules, horses, cattle and hogs as
fine as any country can grow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have visited the fine stockgrowing portions of Kentucky and
Tennessee, but this beats all ever seen before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In addition to growing grain, coffee, sugar and cotton grow as
finely here as in any other part of the province. Farms can be
purchased in this and the adjoining district, with good improvements
in the shape of dwellings, sugar-mills, grist-mills, &#38;c., for
$2.50 per acre and less, that being the highest price asked, and
$1.50 per acre being the usual price asked for lands as good as lands
can be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The best information as to depth of soil is, that it averages about
thirteen (13) feet deep. From the best information we can get, the
good land extends fifty or sixty miles in length and ten or twelve
in breadth. It is not uncommon to see trees seven (7) feet in diameter
here.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The people here treat us with great hospitality, and are exceedingly
anxious for our people to come amongst them, offering inducements
the most substantial, provisions, &#38;c. If this country is ever
peopled by an industrious and progressive race it will soon be a
paradise on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have thus tried to describe this immensely fertile tract of country,
but the description is poor in comparison to the reality. It is
the most desirable I ever expected even to see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have changed my mind in regard to the expense of settling in
this country. When it was said by Mr. Street that we must not
expect to use ploughs the first few years here, I laughed at him.
But he is right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A single man can here clear and fence and plant ten acres of
land in two months.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five acres will make him at least two hundred and fifty bushels
of corn, the other five will make him as much cotton as he can pick,
without other culture than the hoe. So that not only a support may
be made the first year, but also money may be saved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this communication, it is proper to state that
there are large numbers of uncivilized Indians near that region, and
that “not long since the neighboring district of São João Baptista
was the victim of an outbreak of these savages,” as is stated in the
public prints. Facts are important guides to us.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. This embrace consists in passing the arms round each other,
much in the same manner that is observed when two boys are about
to engage in wrestling, and is resorted to very generally among
Brazilian gentlemen, to express a particular regard upon meeting
or parting with each other.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. In addition to the other remarkable things, two very large
cobras were encountered and killed by one of my attendants. This
is a most venomous serpent, and resembles very much the rattle-snake
in its shape and color. These were found close together, and
were supposed to be male and female. Each was lying quietly upon
a separate stump of a large tree, and seemed to bask in the warm
sun without any sense of danger.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They are so unacquainted with man,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Their tameness is shocking to me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Upon seeing the first this man alighted and cut a stick, walking
up deliberately, so as to strike a deadly blow, without any movement
on the part of the snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had remounted when the other was observed, and the same
process was repeated with it as the first. Both were wide awake,
and kept their sly wicked gaze fixed upon their slayer as he advanced,
ready to destroy him if he had afforded the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the exception of a small specimen, about a foot and a half
long, killed near the Jacaré river, these are the only cobras seen
during the tour, and they are unusually large, being three feet long,
with a thickness such as a rattle-snake of similar length would have.
The bite of one of these serpents, without a prompt remedy on hand,
is considered certainly fatal to man or beast, but fortunately they do
not seem to be numerous in any part visited.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. The only means of cleaning the cotton used at this place are
sundry little hand-rollers, worked by little darkies, which cannot
average over two pounds each to the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spirit of enterprise is sadly deficient along this river, though
the communication of the steamboat could place any thing at their
doors that might be desired.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. A considerable lot of cotton gathered from these stalks lies in
the seed at the residence, and does not give evidence of nice handling,
but the fibre is good. Even with the spirit of progress which
Senor Miguel manifests in his appliances generally, the little hand-roller
is his only reliance for picking cotton, and hence this seed
cotton remains on hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has attempted to use an English apparatus with a roughened
roller, but apart from the insufficiency of size it is totally unfitted
for accomplishing any satisfactory results. He is now impressed
with the necessity of supplying himself with a good cotton-gin to
meet the demands of his forthcoming crops here and at Ponto-Grosso.</p>

<p class='c007'>The want of information as to the conditions for proper culture
of cotton is shown in the planting of sugar-cane among the cotton,
and yet I counted upon a single limb of one branch of a large stalk
in that field twenty-two bolls, the entire stalk having certainly over
two hundred bolls.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. This troublesome fly is found to a greater or less extent in various
parts of the country, and seems to attack some animals in a herd in
preference to others. There may be something in the particular
stock of cattle rendering them more liable than others, and it seems
that those in the best condition are generally more exempt; but this
may be an effect rather than a cause, as the presence of these festering
points over a large portion of the surface must prevent the animal
from thriving that is so affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these insects imbedded its germ in two points upon my
person, and I subsequently extracted a rough ugly-looking sort of
worm from one of the places, which was near my shoulder, and
consequently under the clothing. It is a mystery as to how the fly
could deposit the germ through a flannel shirt, which was worn at
the time. This result is liable to occur with children in localities
